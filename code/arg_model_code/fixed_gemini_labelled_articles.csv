"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","Kevin Schade is as close as they come to another recognised striker but Mbeumo is the main man through the middle, and is thriving with five of Brentford's eight league goals.","0"
"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","Thomas Frank is as big a cheerleader as Premier League managers come but he meant it when he said Mbeumo was more of a loss to the team last season during his four-month injury absence than Toney - at the moment he was ruled out, he was on for a 15-goal season.","1"
"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","This time around, he might just manage it.","0"
"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","Five in six is a trajectory he certainly can't continue but it is not just down to fortune, and he is a much better finisher than when Brentford were first promoted.","1"

"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","For a team with the depth and quality of this Hammers side, the lack of memorable moments they produced is still a concern.","1"
"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","The Hammers' defending has been a major cause for concern but their attacking return is an even greater worry when Julen Lopetegui was tasked with delivering a more expansive style.","1"
"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","That will take time but with an expected goals tally lower than Southampton, despite Lucas Paqueta, Mohamed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen featuring in every game, their individual quality should be enough to produce more than this.","1"
"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","Paqueta was a particular oddity in an anonymous showing at the Gtech, and after shuffling over to the touchline when substituted he shook his head in frustration as he reached the substitutes' bench.","0"

"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","This, coupled with the threat they posed in the air from Murillo, Chris Wood and the returning Taiwo Awoniyi, meant the Reds headed into the interval as the better side.","1"
"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","Forest came close to leading through Wood but were denied the opener by a mere matter of inches - but after half-time it was a different story.","0"
"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","Nuno Espirito Santo sacrificed the physicality of Awoniyi for the more technically gifted Anthony Elanga - which was a fair decision.","1"
"PL hits and misses: Palmer makes history; Arsenal become title favourites","It was clear after the restart that more space was available for Fulham, and they quickly made the pressure count from the penalty spot.","1"

"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","Explaining referee Kavanagh's decision, Webb said: He's clearly seen Declan Rice commit a foul, then kick the ball away from an opponent in the process of taking a free-kick.","1"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","We've messaged - clearly and strongly - to the players in pre-season about the importance of not getting involved with the ball once the whistle has gone, not delaying the restart in that way.","1"

"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","Once he has seen Declan Rice deliberately and clearly kick the ball away from the position of that free-kick then I don't think he has any choice but to send him off.","1"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","Arsenal fans were left in uproar on social media when replays showed the ball was rolling before Veltman attempted to kick the ball, meaning Rice's actions were irrelevant","0"

"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","It may have been rolling, but Declan Rice still felt the need to kick that ball away, he said.","0"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","It still has that impact and we have to look at what the player does in that situation.","0"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","He acts in a way that is very clear, he makes a decision to take the ball away from the opponent.","0"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","It's the referee's job to deal with everything else, but in this situation, the actions of Rice were designed to delay the restart so therefore I don't think he can have any complaints when his actions resulted in a yellow card.","1"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","In that situation, the referee focuses on Rice's actions and determines he has to deal with him because those actions are intentionally designed to kick the ball away when he had no business going near the ball in the first place.","1"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","Having given away a free-kick, Rice knows he has got to get away and let that free-kick be taken and the referee deals with everything else.","0"

"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","The officials on the field gave him too much benefit of the doubt, feeling that the actions weren't really impactful because they felt the Arsenal defenders were too far away to take a throw-in, they were too distanced away from the ball, unlike Veltman who was right there.","1"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","But it's quite clear the actions of Pedro do have an impact and do delay Arsenal's ability to restart and yes, that should have been a yellow card and we have communicated that to the officials.","1"

"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","But in the instances where we see that impact, and there was one with Pedro, we should be seeing a yellow card.","1"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","That's the feedback we have given to the officials.","0"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","After the game, Arsenal manager Arteta felt Rice should have been sent off by law - but only if Veltman was also shown a red card for his involvement in the incident.","1"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","Asked about whether the Brighton defender should have also been sent off for violent conduct, Webb said: The ball is there, he\'s taking a free-kick so it's difficult to say anything other than that, really.","0"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","He [Veltman] is looking up the field, he goes to kick the ball which is then moved away from him by Rice's actions.","0"
"Ref told Rice 'I don't like the rule' as he sent him off vs Brighton ","So I don't think there is anything that can be done by that action [of kicking Rice] in those circumstance - when the ball is there to be kicked by a player who has been given a free-kick.","1"

"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","And that impressive start to the campaign, albeit only three games, has led Jamie Carragher to claim his former side may be genuine title challengers this season.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","The majority of the players have won everything there is to win, it gives them real belief in a manager moving forward that maybe this team is closer to challenging for the league title than many people think.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","As the Premier League returns to action this weekend, we take a look at why there are real grounds for optimism ahead for Reds fans this season, as well as sounding a note of caution for Slot and Co.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","When Slot was announced as Klopp's successor in May, many considered it the impossible job trying to replace the iconic German, who had won almost every trophy possible during his near decade-long tenure on Merseyside.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Not only that, but as the summer months ticked by, it soon became clear the new man's sizeable task would not be aided by any new signings after the Reds missed out on their No 1 transfer target, Real Sociedad holding midfielder Martin Zubimendi.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","But having just passed his first 100 days in charge, the 45-year-old has seemingly made a pitch-perfect start to Reds reign, although that will not have surprised sporting director Richard Hughes, who earmarked him for the role.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Hughes, who also joined the club this summer, did his due diligence on Slot and what impressed him most from his time in charge at Feyenoord was his ability to improve players by working with them on the training ground - he is a real tracksuit manager - and his tactical acumen [see the switching of Dominik Szoboszlai's position at Old Trafford].","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Slot has also been sensible by resisting the urge to make sweeping changes to a team that were still chasing a quadruple as late as last April, as can so often be the case when a new manager comes in.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Rather, he has made subtle little tweaks to the team shape, with two No 6s now employed in front of the back four, and personnel, with Diogo Jota preferred to Darwin Nunez as the central striker.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Style-wise, though, there have been some noticeable changes from the Klopp era which we will look at, but at the same time we have still seen the famed Gegenpressing that was a hallmark of the previous manager, such as with Luis Diaz's devastating counterattacking strike after defending a corner against Brentford.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","And while there have certainly been no fist pumps at full time, or pulled hamstrings after charging down touchlines berating officials, Carragher believes it is vital the new man has made such an assured start to his Reds career in order to quell those initial, albeit understandable, doubts.","1"

"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Klopp's brand of high-octane football, or heavy metal as he liked to call it, was thrilling on the eye, but came with huge risks.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Last season, the Reds kept just 10 Premier League clean sheets and conceded on average 1.08 goals a game, while incredibly for a side challenging for the title, they also fell 1-0 behind on 16 occasions.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Ultimately, that was unsustainable as far as a successful title challenge was concerned and while we are only dealing with a tiny sample size of three matches so far this season, already this looks like an area Slot has worked on over the summer, with obvious results.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","As well as the fact that Liverpool have yet to let in a goal this season, they are also facing on average less shots, including on target, less fast breaks, big chances conceded and high turnovers against per game.","0"

"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Slot's Liverpool aren't going to be as exciting as Klopp's - that's impossible.","1"

"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","If Liverpool win more games like this, 2-0, comfortable, then it'll put them in a great position.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","It is at both ends of the pitch, however, that Slot appears to have made improvements from last season, perhaps best illustrated by Diaz's impressive displays on the lefthand side of the attack.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","The Colombian was not certain to start the season given Cody Gakpo's eye-catching performances for the Netherlands at the Euros, but Slot opted for him despite summer speculation about his future and he has been rewarded for his faith.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Diaz has started the season on fire with three goals and an assist to his name in the opening three league games, in contrast to the previous campaign when it took him until November to reach that number of goals - his shot conversion rate is up from a miserly 8.5 per cent in 202324 to 37.5 per cent this campaign - albeit with off-the-field family matters to contend with after his father's kidnapping in Colombia.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Two of those goals came at Old Trafford, with that clinical attacking display in complete contrast to Liverpool's two trips there in March and April when their profligacy in front of goal saw them dumped out of the FA Cup and lose the initiative in the title race respectively.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","In fact, in three meetings with United last season, Liverpool had a mind-boggling 62 shots on goal, scoring just five times, while they netted three times from just 11 efforts in their recent win there, demonstrating a more clinical edge in front of goal as a team in general.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","As a result, Liverpool's shot conversion rate is up from 10.9 per cent under Klopp last season to 14.6 per cent this campaign, as is their big chance conversion rate from 38.3 per cent to 43.8 per cent, with the stats bearing out that while metrics such as shots, high turnovers and direct attacks may all been down on average this season, the important numbers like goals per game, touches in the opposition box and fast breaks are all up.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","And that can only bode well as far as a possible title challenge this season is concerned.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","The one area of the squad Slot identified as needing strengthening on his arrival was the No 6 role, a position Liverpool have been trying to recruit for since the summer of 2022.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","So when Zubimendi, their only target for the role, opted to stay at Sociedad on the eve of the new season, the prevailing wisdom was the Reds could not now compete with City and Arsenal for the title.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Fast forward a month, however, and Ryan Gravenberch's emergence as a credible holding midfielder has altered that thinking, especially after his recent man-of-the-match display at Old Trafford, when the Netherlands international showcased all the requisite skills Slot demands as a No 6 in his teams [see graphics].","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Slot does not want his defensive midfielders to be destroyers sitting in front of the back for putting out fires, instead he likes them to be athletic ball players who after winning back possession, can then get about the pitch and support attacks.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","This was best seen in that game when Gravenberch was both quick to anticipate Casemiro's intended pass for Kobbie Mainoo in the lead-up to the visitors' first goal, as well as in the way he strode over the halfway line - reminiscent of Patrick Viera in his Arsenal heyday - before powering forward to the edge of the box and finding Diaz in space in the move that resulted in Trent Alexander-Arnold's disallowed opening goal.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Again, as the scientists say, it is only a small sample size, with far harder tests to come in the role than Ipswich, Brentford and a lacklustre and malfunctioning United, but so far the signs are promising.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","It can be no coincidence that both City and Arsenal had the fewest number of individual players injured last season, allowing them to rotate at crucial points of the campaign and pick their strongest lineups for the games that mattered most, while in stark contrast only Tottenham Hotspur lost more players to injury (22) than Liverpool (21), according to premierinjuries.com.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","There was even a period in the second half of the season when Klopp had to make do without the likes of key first-team players such as Alexander-Arnold, Mo Salah, Szoboszlai, Alison Becker, Darwin Nunez, Jota and Curtis Jones, the first three all succumbing to repeat injuries after being rushed back too soon.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","How much that ultimately cost Liverpool in their quadruple bid is hard to say, but it is something Hughes and Slot are determined will not be repeated this time around and that is why the Dutchman was so determined to bring Ruben Peeters with him from Feyenord.","1"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","Peeters, who comes with a master's degree in sports sciences from KU Leuven, was head of physical performance at the Eredivisie club and during the 32-year-old's three years working with Slot in Rotterdam, they enjoyed a remarkable 90 per-cent-plus plus player availability level.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","And the early signs look promising, with Slot so far only unable to call upon Jones with a minor muscle twinge in the opening three games of the season, although the midfielder is now back in training.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","So given Liverpool lost injured players for a combined 1,383 days last season, according to premierinjuries.com, Peeters's arrival could prove vital in sustaining any potential title challenge this season by allowing Slot to rest and rotate, especially now they will be playing two games a week.","1"

"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","And the Reds have not had any adversary to face so far, with Slot's side yet to fall behind in a game, while they have also had no injuries to set them back.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","That will, of course, all change over the coming months, with Harvey Elliott having already returned from recent England Under-21 duty with a fractured foot that will sideline him until late October.","0"
"Are Slot's Liverpool Premier League title contenders?","However, Slot can only beat the teams put in front of him and given the assured start he has made to the seemingly impossible job of replacing a Liverpool managerial icon, then there is no reason not to view the Reds as genuine title contenders this season.","1"

"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","It was not quite the same as the Firmino discussion, but it was a question of, like, well, who is he?","1"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Is he a striker?","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","He played as one of the two up front at Wolves and liked to drift wide and cut in quite a lot.","1"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","If you looked at the formation, Jota was a striker in one of two centre-forward positions, but because of how he interpreted that, it looked as though he could play on the left and he could certainly play as a centre-forward if we wanted him as a true centre-forward.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","That was the target, someone who was capable of scoring from those zones.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","What we wanted, for as close to a Mane or a Mo replacement as possible, was a wide forward.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","They are not a striker, they stay wide, but they cut in and have a high shooting volume.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Initially, Jota was defined by his differences with Firmino.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","He is not as all-round a player as Firmino is, but he is a much better finisher than Firmino is, so those skills complement each other.","1"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","More recently, playing centrally, similarities have emerged.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Jota's pressing has been a feature of Liverpool's encouraging start to the season under Slot.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Statistically, he has covered 1.72 kilometres while closing down defenders during the press - which is more than any other Premier League player so far this season.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","He has also been a part of the team's press more than any other Premier League player - doing so 76 times already.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","It is telling that Dominik Szoboszlai and Luis Diaz are also among the top five - but it is Jota, the most advanced player, who triggers that press.","1"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","He can play the Firmino role, even if he does not quite have the same passing game as Firmino, says Graham.","1"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","That is no criticism of Jota.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Very few players do.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Nevertheless, he has created more turnovers through his pressing than any other forward this season.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Jota and Salah combined for the first goal of the Slot era against Ipswich but it is notable that the Portuguese creates space for the Egyptian, albeit in a different way to Firmino.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","He retains that tendency to drift left, which opens up the channel for Salah.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","It is just another reason why he has been preferred by Slot thus far.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","But there is still a wildcard option for the Liverpool manager.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Darwin Nunez has a role to play - even if his particular skillset is less multi-functional.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Darwin really is a centre-forward.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Graham describes Nunez as the last Liverpool signing that he worked on, a parting gift who still divides opinion as he enters his third season at Anfield and approaches a century of appearances.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","With Darwin, there is still that role question, says Graham.","1"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Darwin looked like one of the best young strikers in Europe.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Haaland was the obvious one, but he was out of Liverpool's financial range.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","The transfer fee is not that big a component of the total spend on Haaland.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","So, Haaland was out of the equation.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Darwin was a centre-forward who did centre-forward things.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","So the question was, Firmino's getting older and we are going to have to replace him eventually.","1"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Would the coach be comfortable with the slight change of style that Darwin is going to bring?","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","That change has been no more than a qualified success so far, Nunez\'s finishing being described as unacceptable by Jamie Carragher.","1"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","And yet, the chances keep coming.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Nunez had a shot more regularly than any other Premier League player last season.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","I can only see it from the outside now, so I don't have any special insight into it, but the interesting thing is that with the amount of shots Darwin takes, you would expect him to be taking some from Mo, but he doesn't seem to be taking that many shots from Mo.","1"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Indeed, Salah still ranks fourth on that list himself, his own adaptability a testament to his greatness.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Graham has not given up on Nunez.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Finishing is always a bit of a noisy business, he says.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","And Liverpool's shot generation looks good with him in the team.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","Liverpool never did find a way of replacing Firmino like for like.","0"
"Jota or Nunez? Replacing Firmino at Liverpool explained","But in acquiring two very different players who are capable of operating in that centre-forward position, and with the help of Salah somehow maintaining his own levels, perhaps they will not need to.","1"

"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","If you prepare well, if you have quality, then the normal outcome is a lot of wins at a club like Liverpool.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","Yeah, maybe you should.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But I think it would be a really strange decision also if this club had been so successful with Jurgen and so many players are still there, then to change everything.","1"

"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","So sometimes a player sees a chance, feels that that is the moment to play the difficult ball.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","And if it happens, I'm the first one to say, well done.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But if it doesn't, you see me at the line like, why does he make this difficult choice?","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","It stays a game for the players.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","And as much as they can, they have to make the right choices and the best possible executions.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But I think they cope quite well, especially if I look at the game against Ipswich, where I think we dominated possession and we controlled the game really well by possession.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But then the next thing is to create more chances if you have the ball so much.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","We had a few, but in my opinion, not enough.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","So again, we don't reach perfection, but we are far away from perfection at the moment.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","Yeah, but more than that, I think it's also about if you had to run a lot to recover the ball, to get the ball back, and then if you lose it, immediately afterwards, I see players from my team with their head down thinking, s**t, we have to defend again, we have to run again.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But the other team gets a lot of confidence because they immediately have the ball back again.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","So, it's not only this extra pass that maybe gives you a better rest defence, football is also a mental game.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","And if you have the ball a lot, you feel more comfortable, you feel better.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","So, yeah, if this pass after transition immediately leads to a chance and the fans are loud, that also gives you the right energy, mental energy.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But if you pick out a difficult ball without, so a lot of risk, without a lot of reward, if it finds your team-mate, then I think another choice would have been better.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","He is very comfortable with the ball, and I think that's what everybody saw, but not every manager.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","So, it's a bit of a choice.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","You can bring a No 6 in that's only really good without the ball - hard tackles and sliding - which every fan loves, and a lot of pundits love as well.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","Or you look more at what can he bring for us if we have the ball, and I think he can help us a lot with the ball.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","And he has a good tackle, but he's not a... Where would you compare him?","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","He's not an N'Golo Kante, he's a Declan Rice, whatever you want to come up with.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But he is a very good runner, so he has long legs, he can keep on running, closing down lines.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","Is that the way to say it?","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","So, he is not the typical No 6 that is making sliding tackles of three or four or five metres, which a lot of fans also like to see.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But if you play in a possession-based team, which he does, it's a lot about keeping the ball, making the right decisions if you have the ball, and bringing the ball from the last line towards the forwards.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","It's just a bit of how you look at a player.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But in the end, he also surprised me, not how comfortable he is with the ball, but also how trustable he is without the ball.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","And I think that is something he picked up really fast, or which was maybe already inside of him, but people and me never saw before.","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","Talking about risk and reward!","0"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","And the choices he makes in which moment, then he's one of the players that can make his decisions sometimes better, in my opinion.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But to have a right full-back that is so special with the ball, yeah, that's an extra quality Liverpool had for so many years, and I'm lucky enough to have that still, because how many full-backs create so many chances for their team?","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","So, he should keep bringing this risk to his game and in some moments find other options as well.","1"
"Slot on risk vs reward; perfection and 'special' Alexander-Arnold","But I also have to address, in my opinion, how well he's defending at Liverpool in the last few games we've played.","0"

"Why 'rock and roll' Bournemouth 'should' be fourth","Last season, we played a little bit higher than they used to play before, but I think we still needed to support the forwards more, because if you want to press high, you have to be very compact and not leave space in between the lines for the midfielders.","1"
