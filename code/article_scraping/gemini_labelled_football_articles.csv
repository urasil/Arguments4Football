"Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham","Everton's games with West Ham have seemed to become obligatory win-or-bust games for both managers in the last few seasons, and this weekend's meeting the London Stadium appears no different with newspaper rumours Lopetegui could be replaced if they lose.","1"
