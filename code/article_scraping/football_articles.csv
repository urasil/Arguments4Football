Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,The Saturday late kick-off tends to bring with it a special atmosphere but there was an additional spring in the step of the Anfield masses ahead of Liverpool's game against Aston Villa.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Manchester City's latest defeat offered the opportunity to move five points clear.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Liverpool seized that chance, punishing Villa with two counter-attacks, one in each half, the first set up by Mohamed Salah and the second finished by him."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,There were moments of control but that pace on the counter-attack remains a feature of this team.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"In beating Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 on Tuesday, Luis Diaz had been the hat-trick hero with Cody Gakpo also on target."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Here, Diaz moved wide to accommodate Darwin Nunez who duly delivered the breakthrough goal."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Salah, of course, remains the chief architect."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"With Diogo Jota to return, the firepower is there for Liverpool, the form of Curtis Jones proving a reminder of the options in midfield too."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,The schedule looks demanding throughout the winter but there are some signs that Arne Slot could manage the workload.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"It was not the perfect performance from Slot's side, not the perfect night either with Trent Alexander-Arnold going off injured before the interval, but there is a momentum to Liverpool's season that Arsenal and Man City lack."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,It is 15 wins from 17 for Slot now.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"City might be expected to regroup during the international break, but that five-point lead brings belief."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Maybe it will not need north of 90 points to claim this particular Premier League title.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"If so, 28 from 11 puts Liverpool ahead of the game."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Anfield is abuzz again.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Why are Man City less convincing now?
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"They seem to have holes from front to back - and at the back, Rodri's absence looks likely to be the critical factor."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Brighton created eight big chances in their 2-1 win according to Opta - that is the most City have conceded in a single game under Pep Guardiola.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Since Rodri's injury, City have been so open on the counter-attack."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"In all competitions, they have conceded 26 shots from fast breaks this season - that is more than any Premier League side."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"With the Spaniard out, City are simply unable to snuff out teams breaking them in the transitions, and therefore have less dominance on a game."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,That load to stop fast breaks has been shared out in this City team to little effect.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Mateo Kovacic has been unable to stop the flow and not even Kyle Walker's pace can bail them out.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"The right-back was constantly troubled by Kaoru Mitoma and Pervis Estupinan down that flank, it was no surprise that Brighton's equaliser came from that side of the pitch."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,The second goal?
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Rodri's absence could be pointed out again.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,How easy was it for Carlos Baleba to find Joao Pedro with a pass through the middle of the pitch?
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Then for Pedro to find Matt O'Riley for the winner?
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"If there was not any doubt before, Man City miss Rodri."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"With injury-hit Crystal Palace forced to field Marc Guehi and debutant Justin Devenny in a makeshift midfield, Emile Smith Rowe must have been licking his lips."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"The in-form Fulham forward feasted on the space he was able to find in that area of the pitch, picking out the runs of his team-mates beyond a stretched defence, and finding the net himself."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,The narrowest of offside calls saw him miss out on a second goal.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,It was a performance which may have been aided by Palace's problems but it underlined the fine form rejuvenated Smith Rowe has found at Fulham.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Having watched him up close twice in the space of a week, it is clear to see the confidence and verve which propelled him into the spotlight at Arsenal is back."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,After all his injury problems that is something to be celebrated.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"After steps forward against Tottenham, Aston Villa and Wolves, Crystal Palace were suffering again on Saturday, when their bare-bones squad was beaten 2-0 by Fulham."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Wolves' win at Southampton has darkened their situation.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Just one point and goal difference spares them from a place in the relegation zone.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Their absentee number is extensive - there were two goalkeepers and three teenagers on their bench.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"At Selhurst Park, Will Hughes' suspension added to an injury list including chief creator Eberechi Eze and forward Eddie Nketiah."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Hughes will be back for the trip to Aston Villa after the international break but now Daichi Kamada will be missing after his straight red.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Of the players in the treatment room?
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""It could be that no one comes back,"" said boss Oliver Glasner."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""Maybe one."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Maximum two straight after the international break."""
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Even with those mitigating circumstances - how could a makeshift midfield of Guehi and Devenny cope with Fulham's playmakers?
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,- Glasner was less than impressed with his side's performance.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""We made too many easy mistakes,"" he said, listing similar errors against Nottingham Forest and Wolves."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"When Brighton sold Moises Caicedo, you just knew they had a plan."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,There was one man they wanted and paid Lille £23.2m for him.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"It has taken time for it to look like money well spent, but Carlos Baleba is starting to look the real deal in this Brighton midfield."

Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Wolves have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premier League - but they put that behind them for the crucial fixture against Southampton.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,O'Neil's team saw less of the ball - only 28 per cent of it to be exact - but limited Southampton to just one shot on target as they won 2-0.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"They were organised and disciplined throughout, which will be welcomed by management, players and the fanbase."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""We were solid,"" O'Neil said after securing the first clean sheet of the season."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""Took a bit of moving around as their shape caused us some issues."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"We spoke about being humble enough about defending low."""
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"As this performance shows, Wolves have sufficient quality in the squad to threaten teams in this league through the likes of Matheus Cunha and Joao Gomes."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Scoring has never been the problem, it is shutting teams out which has caused them to plummet down the standings."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Staying on the topic of goals - but for all the wrong reasons in Southampton's case.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,No team has scored less than them in the Premier League and this game showed exactly why.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Russell Martin's side had 72 per cent of the ball at Molineux - but this translated to just 0.60xG in front of goal.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"In fact, despite having almost triple the amount of possession, Saints recorded just one more touch than their opponents in the penalty area."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,It is a statistic which only highlights the serious problem plaguing Southampton and Martin is well aware of it.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""We should do more with the ball,"" he said."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""To be in the final third as much as we were, I would expect us to have something to show for it."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,It is not good enough.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,We were made to pay for individual errors.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""We played really good football until we got there."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,There has to be more.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"The only thing I am disappointed with is that we did not create more."""
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""I don't remember a quality first half."""
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,That was Julen Lopetegui's take on an awful opening 45 minutes which did little to lift the gloom at the London Stadium.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"By the end, West Ham had marginally improved, but it was not enough to prevent loud boos ringing out at full-time as they drew 0-0 with Everton."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"After 11 games in charge, many supporters have made up their minds on their new manager."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Jordan Pickford made six saves - his most in a Premier League match since April - but Lopetegui pointing out how the Everton goalkeeper was among the best players was clutching at straws.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"A better side would have punished just how poorly West Ham started, and addressing how sluggish they have been in first halves throughout the season is something Lopetegui is yet to rectify."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,It was not until the 44th minute that Pickford had a save to make.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""The first half was not good but we had four or five clear chances in the second,"" said a bullish Hammers boss."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""Sometimes it is about having personality to grow up in situations."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"We need to have the attitude to be one aggressive team."""
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,This gutsy goalless draw was not the sort you wanted to lose.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Seven days ago at St Mary's, Everton managed to be on the receiving end of a late sucker-punch, and when Danny Ings came on as a second-half substitute, many of those who had made the journey south to the capital would have feared a similar outcome."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Only Pickford's brilliance ensured that would not be the case, but in truth neither side deserved a win from a joyless encounter desperately lacking in quality."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Crysencio Summerville's defending was actually the highlight of a dreadful opening 45 minutes.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,His moment at the other end came from a rare flicker of guile as Lucas Paqueta dissected Everton's defence.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""It's a good point and good clean sheet,"" said Sean Dyche."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""We couldn't find that edge in the final third or that bit of devil which could have made a difference."""
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,It is clear to see what Dyche means about finding the devil.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"It is no surprise, given Dwight McNeil was missing through injury."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,No player has played more passes into the box (including crosses) in the Premier League this season than McNeil heading into the weekend (86).
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Bournemouth's last two impressive results, a 1-1 draw at Aston Villa and the 1-0 home win over champions Manchester City, were in part thanks to the fine goalkeeping of deputy Mark Travers, standing in for the injured Kepa Arrizabalaga."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,But his player-of-the-match performance at Villa Park and a point-blank stop to keep out Erling Haaland in added time were not enough to convince head coach Andoni Iraola to keep him in the side at Brentford with Kepa once again available after returning to fitness.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Iraola's change, perhaps predictably, knowing Kepa's frailties at dealing with crosses and Brentford being one of the most direct teams in the Premier League, shone an unwanted spotlight on the goalkeeping situation at Bournemouth with the Spaniard struggling as the Cherries lost 3-2."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Kepa flapped at crosses throughout the game, and it was his inability to hold on to a ball into the box that led to Brentford getting the throw-in from which Yoane Wissa headed in a first-half equaliser."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"But the most glaring of errors on a difficult afternoon for the Chelsea loanee, signed for a world-record £71.6m fee for a goalkeeper from Athletic Bilbao in 2018, was his failure to cover his near post for Mikkel Damsgaard's equaliser in the second half."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Iraola defended his goalkeeper in his post-match press conference, in which Kepa was the most asked about topic, but even the head coach acknowledged he could have done better for Brentford's second equaliser."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,The Bournemouth boss will have plenty of time over the international break to consider how he handles this situation moving forward.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"But there is a decision to make with Travers, now 25, likely to be seeking more game-time and Kepa's future beyond this season unclear."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Brentford made headlines earlier in the season for scoring in the first two minutes for four Premier League games running.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"They repeated their party trick, mid-game admittedly, against Bournemouth, equalising to make it 2-2 just 21 seconds after the restart."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,No sooner had Bournemouth taken the lead through a wonderfully worked set-piece goal finished off by Justin Kluivert than they were picking the ball out of their own net.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"It was a killer blow, one that likely decided the game, turning the momentum on its head."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Iraola, the Bournemouth boss, was frustrated after the game because his side knew what was coming but could not stop it."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"""We know."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,Everyone knows.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,They score a lot of goals after kick-offs.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,They go back and then go long on the left.
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"You have to be better than them."""
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Bournemouth, on this occasion, were not."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Others have tried and failed to stop Brentford, the Premier League's restart kings."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Man City, Tottenham, West Ham and Wolves fell victim to this earlier in the season."
Hits and misses: Could Liverpool win the title?,"Likely others will follow, too."

Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"The ex-Wolves boss had been pragmatic in the manner he saved Molineux from a return to the Championship but with the promise of greater resources in London, there was hope this job would elicit more memories of his time in charge of Sevilla where he won the Europa League only four years ago, albeit in style more than silverware."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,More than £130m has been spent on what appeared individually to be sensible signings - although they have produced little to justify the third-biggest net outlay across the Premier League last summer.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"No-one expected perfect free-flowing football on the table after 10 games, but they expected some sign of a direction of travel."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"But after years of relative stability, with the caveat of defensive football, under Moyes, the chaotic underbelly at the London Stadium has returned."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Something has to change, and fast."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Everton's games with West Ham have seemed to become obligatory win-or-bust games for both managers in the last few seasons, and this weekend's meeting the London Stadium appears no different with newspaper rumours Lopetegui could be replaced if they lose."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,It is a remarkable situation given the optimism around East London less than three months ago that he could be out the door quicker than his ill-fated Real Madrid reign in 2018.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"West Ham's start to the season has been poor, but the glacial move towards the more progressive style desired has been his biggest hindrance."

Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Now 10 games in, it is still only Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus - far more creative players by nature - who can match his 40 opposition-box touches, and both have enjoyed more game time than he has this season."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,West Ham are playing fewer passes in the opposition half than at any stage under Moyes.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,The percentage of long passes is stubbornly refusing to drop.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Fans are becoming frustrated by a lack of tangible progress, both from results and what they can see with their own eyes."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,Lopetegui insisted his philosophy is developing at the London Stadium in the build-up to the Everton game before caveating he has had to adapt to his players too.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"But with Lucas Paqueta, Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen at his disposal, a trio who created 94 chances between them last season, this is not a team lacking in attacking creativity or technical ability."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,Paqueta racked up almost half of those chances himself but his drop in form represents one of the new head coach's biggest headaches.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"He is the creative lynchpin he would want, but under Lopetegui his chance creation has dropped by around a third, not helped by muddled tactical thinking from his new manager."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"It took Moyes time to get the best out of the Brazilian but by last season, he had found home almost exclusively on the left flank."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"This season he has drifted inside more, but has affected the game far less."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Understandably he is beating his man barely half as much as he was, but in a role where he should be creating more, his expected assists have experienced a similar drop."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Things were at their worst at Nottm Forest last weekend, where Paqueta found himself the one making runs in behind the home defence to latch onto long balls forward from Bowen."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"He made more runs into the box than in any other game this season, but this should be Bowen's job."

Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Externally, the blame for West Ham's transfer issues has been laid at the feet of technical director Tim Steidten, who despite a questionable recruitment record at the London Stadium is said to be in the running for the vacant sporting director post at Arsenal."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Kudus is the only one of 10 major signings under his remit whose introduction has been a clear success, though last summer's six newcomers still need time to bed in."

Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"It does not help that in the most physically demanding league in world football both he and Soucek, who have started six of 10 league games together, rank in the 20 slowest midfielders in the Premier League this season."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,Not that pace alone makes a good midfield.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"But if West Ham are going to control games and play further up the pitch, they will open themselves up to counter attacks and will need pace in transition."

Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"That is a problem beyond Lopetegui's making, but it is one he needs to fix."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,He is yet to find a solution but tried to paper over it at Forest last weekend when he switched to a 3-4-3 for the first time.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"The third centre-back also aimed to offer extra cover to the attacking remit Lopetegui has handed his full-backs, who are ending up inside the opposition box almost twice as much as they were in Moyes' last season."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Ignoring the unusual decisions further forward, defensively there was some logic to it."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,But Lopetegui's players look devoid of confidence and belief as much as they do tactical understanding at this point.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,The debacle at Tottenham three weeks ago summed it up.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Unusually resolute for 45 minutes after taking an early lead, they collapsed once Yves Bissouma put them behind for the first time in the match and conceded three goals in eight minutes as their heads dropped."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,Lopetegui stressed the importance of belief and consistency in his pre-match press conference on Thursday.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"""We have to create a kind of strength inside the team,"" he said."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,Confidence is a commodity hard-earned and easily lost in football.
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"Facing an Everton side with four points from five away games presents an opportunity to build that momentum, and a chance to move within touching distance of the top half."
Why optimism has vanished within 10 games for Lopetegui's West Ham,"But with a fragile mental state, key players absent in Kudus and Alvarez and a manager who doesn't appear to know his best team, that may prove easier said than done."

'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"His spectacular equalising goal against Manchester United, volleyed past Andre Onana from outside the box at Old Trafford, propelled his name into the headlines but Caicedo has been excelling all season."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"""Moi is showing how good he is,"" said Enzo Maresca."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Chelsea sit fourth going into the weekend, seven places and six points better off than at the same stage of last season."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Caicedo has been the driving force, snapping into challenges at the base of midfield and showing his quality on the ball as well as off it."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"He is only of only four outfielders, along with Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson and Levi Colwill, to have started every Premier League game under Maresca."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,Only Colwill has played more minutes.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,It underlines Caicedo's importance to his new head coach.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"He featured prominently under Mauricio Pochettino too, of course, starting 20 consecutive Premier League fixtures between December and May."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,But his £115m price-tag weighed heavily.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,He was unable to replicate the performance levels shown at Brighton.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,That has changed this season.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Chelsea, so often overrun in midfield last term, their openness reflected by a total of 67 goals conceded in 38 games, have let in only 12 in 10 this time around."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,The improvement is a consequence of limiting opposition chances more effectively.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,Chelsea are facing fewer shots than last season and giving up fewer expected goals against.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Crucially, they are allowing fewer touches in, and passes into, their penalty box."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,It owes a lot to the defensive screen provided by the tenacious Caicedo.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"His combined total of 52 tackles and interceptions, 14 of which came in his dominant displays against Manchester United and Newcastle, is the highest of any Premier League player this season."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,Maresca puts his improvement down to time.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"""Most of the time in football, one plus one is not two,"" he said."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"""Just because he was so good at Brighton, that doesn't mean that when he joins Chelsea he is automatically going to be as good."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"""He needs a little bit more time to adapt."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Chelsea is a big club, one of the best in the world, so the impact is not easy."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"When players join Chelsea, it is not automatic."""
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Maresca's comments called to the mind a conversation last year with Caicedo's old coach at Independiente del Valle in Ecuador,Miguel Angel Ramirez, who fondly recalled the youthful innocence of a player who was prone to crying at harsh treatment in training."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"One anecdote involved a tearful reaction to being denied a request for a day off to celebrate his birthday with his family, three hours' drive away from the club's training base."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"His nickname in Ecuador, 'Niño Moi', or 'The Boy Moi', is another nod to that character."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"In hindsight, it is easy to see why his move to Chelsea, completed only a few years later, aged 21, might have taken some getting used to."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Going from Ecuador to Brighton was a step up too, of course."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,But not on the scale of becoming a £115m signing at Chelsea.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,Caicedo needed time to acclimatise.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,But his improvement is down to tactical adjustments too.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,His heat maps show how his role has changed.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,Caicedo is less active in the opposition half under Maresca and more focused on performing the duties of a No 6.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,The narrower remit means he is seeing less of the ball.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,His touches and passes are down by roughly 20 per cent this season.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"But that reduced responsibility in possession, enabled partly by Chelsea's full-backs being asked to tuck into midfield by Maresca, helps to explain his immense defensive contribution."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"He continues to contribute offensively, of course."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,His stunning goal at Old Trafford was the latest reminder that.

'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"From boy to man, he is showing them all now."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,Arsenal's trip to Stamford Bridge will stir fond memories for Gabriel Martinelli.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"On his first visit to the ground in January 2020, soon after Mikel Arteta's appointment, he underlined his huge potential with an exhilarating solo goal following a run from just outside his own box which left N'Golo Kante scrambling in his wake."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Martinelli remains a livewire, five years on, furiously hard-working and capable of blistering directness."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,But there is no escaping the decline in the numbers that matter most.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Since a stellar 202223 campaign, his goals and assists have trended in the wrong direction."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"It seemed he might have turned a corner recently, when he produced two goals and two assists in three consecutive Premier League games before an eye-catching display in Europe against Shakhtar Donetsk in which his low effort forced the decisive own goal."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,But consistency continues to elude him.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,A player so clinical at his best too often lacks confidence and conviction in his execution in and around the opposition box.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"In his defence, it is no coincidence his best run of the season came when he had a consistent presence behind him at left-back, with Riccardo Calafiori starting seven games in a row before suffering an injury last month."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"Since then, Arteta has had to chop and change."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,That inconsistency has been a theme of the last two seasons.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"While Bukayo Saka has mostly benefitted from stability on the opposite flank, with Ben White at right-back and Odegaard on the inside, Martinelli has had to adapt to a revolving cast, both at left-back, where Oleksandr Zinchenko has lost his place, and in the left-sided No 8 role vacated by Granit Xhaka."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,The circumstances go some way to explaining Martinelli's struggles.
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,"But Arsenal need more, even with Odegaard returning."
'Niï¿½o Moi' grows up to become Chelsea's driving force,Stamford Bridge would be a fitting setting for him to deliver again.

Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"""He has been playing very well all the season,"" said Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola of Semenyo afterwards."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"""I think we demand him a lot because I think he can give a lot, and today probably he scores and everyone gives him more recognition."""
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"It is almost three years since a player - Adama Traore, predictably - completed six dribbles in a Premier League game against City."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,Semenyo's showing coupled with the victory justified Iraola's surprise move to switch his winger to the left for this game.
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,The decision was not made to target Walker.
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"""It was more defensive minded because we decided the job defensively that the right winger had to do was more difficult."""
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"While Marcus Tavernier focused on that, Semenyo was free to cause problems for City."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,Not that his own defensive work is unimpressive.
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,Semenyo actually ranks third in the Premier League for possessions won in the attacking third of the pitch.
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"As for shots taken, only Erling Haaland has more of them than the Ghanaian so far this season."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"While a third of those shots have been from outside the box, the only wide forward with a higher expected-goals total than Semenyo this season is Mohamed Salah."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"In this form, perhaps it is no surprise that Liverpool have been linked with a move for him."

Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,Salah's last 130 Premier League goals have been scored from an expected-goals figure of 129.86.
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"Since signing for Liverpool in the summer of 2017, Salah has had 2261 touches of the ball in the opposition penalty box, which is almost twice as many as any other player except Raheem Sterling - and it is over 600 more touches than him."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,It is astonishing.
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"Ballon d'Or winner Rodri may have the most touches of anyone on the pitch but in the box, it is Salah who is still king."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"If he can continue to defy the ageing process and find ways of creating space for himself in there, expect the magic moments to keep coming."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"Chelsea's draw at Manchester Unitedwas a scrappy affair short on quality, although Moises Caicedo did come out of it with the player of the match award and his reputation enhanced."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,It was his volley low into the corner of the net that earned Chelsea a point.
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"There were times last season when Caicedo appeared burdened by that £115m fee that Brighton were paid for his services, seemingly dragged down by the malaise at Stamford Bridge."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,One year on and we are starting to see the talent that sparked the transfer.
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"""Players are human beings,"" said Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"""It is normal to have little ups and downs."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"Since we arrived, Moi is improving a lot."

Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"""Most of the time in football, one plus one is not two."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"Because he was so good at Brighton, that does not mean that when he joins Chelsea he is automatically going to be as good as he was at Brighton."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"He needs a little bit more time to adapt."""
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"Caicedo, who turned 23 on Saturday, now leads the Premier League for tackles made this season."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"He also ranks in the top 10 for interceptions, possession won in the middle third of the pitch and possession won in the final third of the pitch for that matter."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"With confidence, his work on the ball is becoming tidier."
Why Salah is still the king of the penalty box,"Early in his Chelsea career, he was targeted in the build-up."

'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Erik ten Hag's inability to implement a discernible style of play atManchester Unitedwas one of his biggest problems, so it is hardly surprising that, in Ruben Amorim, the club have chosen a manager with a clear identity as the Dutchman's successor."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Across a four-year spell at Sporting, during which he has won two Portuguese league titles and two league cups - having previously won the league cup with Braga - the 39-year-old put a stamp on the side which has remained consistent despite player turnover."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Amorim's Sporting are characterised by a short-passing possession game, a three-at-the-back set-up and an aggressive pressing system facilitated by a high defensive line."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"But as he prepares to take the reins at Old Trafford on November 11, with his first game to be the trip to Ipswich after the international break, how will his methods translate at Manchester United?"
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,It appears unlikely that Amorim will deviate from a back three given he has deployed the system in all 188 league and European games at Sporting.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"According to Opta, his most common starting formation is 3-4-2-1, ahead of 3-4-3, with 3-5-2 the only other used."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,It will take some getting used to for his new players.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Under Ten Hag, Manchester United started almost 90 per cent of league and European games in a 4-2-3-1 shape."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"They did not start a single game in those competitions using a back three, according to Opta."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Matthijs de Ligt is the most likely option to line up in the centre of Amorim's back three at United, given the importance of leadership and experience in that role, although Harry Maguire would be another option having played there for England."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"The wide centre-back positions, meanwhile, look better-suited to Leny Yoro, who has the youthful energy to cover the space behind a wing-back, and the versatile Lisandro Martinez."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Yoro remains untested in the Premier League, of course, having suffered a foot injury in pre-season."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,But his potential is not in doubt and the added security of playing alongside two central defenders rather than one could help him bed in when he returns to fitness.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"The strength in numbers could benefit Martinez, too."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Athough one of United's better players under Ten Hag, he has struggled at times in a two."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"On the left of a three, he could replicate the crucial role of Goncalo Inacio, who occupies the same position at Sporting."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Like Martinez, Inacio is a distinguished passer."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"""There's no doubt he is the best on the ball, so they try and build up through him,"" Carragher said of Inacio."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,His average of 95.9 passes per 90 minutes this season is in fact the highest in the Portuguese league.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,Inacio was asked to thread passes forward to Sporting's midfielders and forwards wherever possible and Amorim will doubtless demand similar of Martinez.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"According to Second Spectrum tracking data for this season, his total of 746 defenders bypassed is 54 per cent higher than any other United player's."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"He is, in other words, already fulfilling a similar task, something which is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by Amorim as he draws up his plans for his defence in and out of possession."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Amorim's back three becomes a back five when defending but his wing-backs are primarily attacking weapons, responsible for providing width and contributing goals and assists."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Ten Hag sought to use his full-backs similarly, asking them to push high up in possession, but the approach was flawed, with his two centre-backs unable to cover the space behind them and United's opponents repeatedly taking advantage from turnovers."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"With better cover, the same players would be able to focus on their attacking responsibilities without as much fear of being exposed at the other end."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot are natural full-backs rather than wing-backs but they are certainly capable in the final third and the same goes for the injured Luke Shaw.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Carragher, though, sees it as a potential problem area for Amorim at United."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"""They are well covered at centre-back but you do scratch your head and think, 'What is he going to do wing-back-wise?'"
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Because it is a specialist position."""
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Amorim does at least have experience of helping a long line of players thrive there at Sporting, including Pedro Porro, whose 13 goals and 14 assists in two-and-a-half seasons in Lisbon earned him his £39.7m move to Tottenham."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"More recently, Nuno Santos has been even more effective, contributing four goals and 10 assists in 32 league games last season playing almost exclusively as a left wing-back."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Santos, like others to have been used in the position by Amorim, is a natural winger, which raises the possibility, however unlikely it may seem, of a more attacking wide player, such as Alejandro Garnacho, Amad Diallo or even Antony being redeployed in the position."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Carragher did, however, insist that Amorim will need to consider the quality of United's opponents."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"""That is talking about Manchester United dominating the ball, maybe being at Old Trafford."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"But when you actually look at the fixture list, with Arsenal away coming up, that will be an interesting decision."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"""If he's got Garnacho in the left wing-back position and he starts well, but you're playing against [Bukayo] Saka, and Arsenal are dominating and on the front foot, and he's being asked to play as a left full-back..."""
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"""Is he going to ask Garnacho to come back in defence as well?"
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,He is an attacking player.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,I'm pretty sure he would hate defending and going back because he would waste his energy.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Then, when he goes up, he's going to be tired."""
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Carragher added: ""Is that what makes this system difficult?"
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"You have to have specialists in the wing-back positions and there are not many of them about at United."""
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Manuel Ugarte shone under Amorim at Sporting, making the jump from squad player to key figure over the course of two seasons before his £50m move to Paris Saint-Germain."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"After an awkward start at United, the familiarity of his former boss should help."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Ugarte still needs to adapt to the demands of the Premier League, of course."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,But Amorim knows how to get the best out of him.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,He did that at Sporting by allowing him to play to his strengths.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"While others, such as Inacio, were asked to focus on progressing the ball, Ugarte was left to focus on winning it back."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,The Uruguayan ranked sixth among Sporting players for passes per 90 minutes in the 202223 season but the volume of his defensive work was impressive.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,His total of 121 tackles was the highest in Portugal and the fourth-highest across Europe's major leagues.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,His ball-winning ability was used as a means of protecting Sporting's defence.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,But it was also harnessed further forward.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"""When I've seen Sporting Lisbon play, these two central midfield players don't just sit and not move,"" said Carragher."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"""In terms of pressing, they will sometimes push right up and be really aggressive on the opposition's central midfielders."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"It will be about energy there."""
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Indeed, while ostensibly a defensive midfielder, Ugarte was key to Sporting's high-press, winning possession in the final third 23 times in 202223, the highest total by any player in the division."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"His understanding of Amorim's off-the-ball approach could be helpful to the new boss and the hope for United is that his tigerish qualities will work well alongside the ball-playing ability of someone like Kobbie Mainoo, another player Amorim - a manager with a track record for nurturing young talent - will aim to develop."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"There are of course other midfield options for Amorim to consider, including Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen and Casemiro."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,He could even deploy Bruno Fernandes in a deeper role.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,But Amorim generally prefers more defensively-minded players in his midfield two.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"The 30-year-old, whose move from Sporting to United came a few weeks before Amorim's appointment at the club in March 2020, appears more likely to be used in support of the striker."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,It is of course in those areas that Fernandes is most effective.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,Amorim's use of Pedro Goncalves in a similar role at Sporting is a possible clue as to how he might be used.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Encouraged to drift infield from the left flank, Goncalves, known as Pote, has racked up outstanding numbers under Amorim, scoring 81 goals and providing 56 assists in 187 games in all competitions."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Marcus Rashford's preference for cutting inside from the left may mean Fernandes is used off the opposite flank, but he would still have access to the central zones from which he is so dangerous."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,It is only in the last two seasons at Sporting that Amorim has had the luxury of a truly prolific out-and-out striker.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Before the arrival of Viktor Gyokeres, scorer of 59 goals in 65 games for the club, his top scorers were wide players Goncalves and Pablo Sarabia."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"But his success with Gyokeres still offers hope that he could get more from United's frontmen, particularly the £72m Rasmus Hojlund, who has scored only 18 times in 52 games in all competitions since his arrival at Old Trafford from Atalanta last year."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Hojlund, although quick, has not demonstrated the same power and ball-carrying ability as Gyokeres, whose directness has given Sporting a new dimension."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,But he would certainly benefit from the kind of service the Sweden international has received under Amorim.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,Comparing their output over the last two seasons highlights the difference on that front.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"While Gyokeres has averaged nearly four shots per 90 minutes in Portugal, Hojlund's average is way down at only 1.6 per 90 minutes at United."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"It is hardly surprising, then, that his goal total is far lower."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,Shot volume is key for strikers.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,Hojlund's isolation under Erik ten Hag was not just limited to his shots.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,He has averaged only 28.4 touches per 90 minutes at United compared to Gyokeres' 44.6 per 90 minutes at Sporting.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,Gyokeres gets more than twice as many touches in the opposition box.
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"Gyokeres is helped, in part, by the proximity of Sporting's wide players, who are better able to link up with him thanks to their tucked-inside positioning."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,"By asking the same of his wide players at United, Amorim would hope to increase Hojlund's overall involvement and, in turn, his scoring output."
'Amorim-ball' analysed - and how Man Utd could line up,It is just one of many areas of tactical intrigue ahead of Amorim's eagerly-anticipated arrival.
