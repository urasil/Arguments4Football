Arguments:
a nine-point gap is big at any stage of the season but there is still hope for the gunners because of martin odegaard.
the skipper hadn't started a game since august 31 because of injury but he returned at stamford bridge and showed just how big a miss he's been for mikel arteta.
i don't know another player that is capable of doing that after six weeks out, arteta said in his post-match press conference.
a cute pass got arsenal going forward and his willingness to run and start arsenal's press was so evident.
the goal then showed you how important he is to arsenal.
arsenal's goal showed you the odegaard effect, sky sports' jamie redknapp said.
he doesn't just give you so much going forward but winning the ball back and pressing high.
their performances will no just go up and up and up now he's back in the team.
this is not to say chelsea are in the race or should be talked about as potential title winners, but there is a lot to be encouraged by at stamford bridge.
there is always going to be a problem holding ange postecoglou back at tottenham.
it revolves around the fact his team usually have to score two or more goals in a game to get a result.
tottenham's style means they are vulnerable via so many avenues: set-pieces to start with - cameron burgess hit the crossbar before ipswich even took their lead on the way to a 2-1 win.
and when the play turns over spurs offer so much space to wide forwards as sammie szmodics found out during a performance he will remember for a long time.
his cameo as caretaker boss has been significant in its own way, already lifting the gloom.
the goals are flowing once again and one can only wonder what the departed manager must make of it all, no doubt telling himself his team were on the cusp of this regardless, but the mood has changed.
how much can be read into it tactically remains to be seen given the dutchman has done it his way, not switching to the system ruben amorim is likely to adopt.
there is a sense that united have got this right.
this club knows a thing or two about false dawns in recent years, even the dangers of believing a former favourite in front of goal can change it all in the dugout.
this was a tactical masterclass by the impressive mckenna, who showed everyone why manchester united and chelsea were genuinely considering giving him the keys to their club in the summer.
the right side of midfield is a problem position but joelinton certainly looked comfortable in scoring the winning goal, sky sports\' jamie carragher said during newcastle\'s 3-1 win at nottingham forest.
sometimes, he plays in the front three and other times he's in the midfield three this season and has even had a man-marking job so he's really disciplined wherever you put him.
you're never quite sure where he's going to be playing when you cover newcastle but what you do know is that he's definitely going to be playing.
his absence during the second half of the last campaign, when he underwent surgery for a thigh injury, was a big factor in eddie howe's side falling short in securing european football.
very few would have tipped liverpool to make such a positive start to life under slot given the fact he was faced with the task of filling the sizeable shoes of a departing jurgen klopp.
it's form that opta says has positioned liverpool in the box seat to end manchester city's four-year reign as champions, with a 60.32 per cent chance of bringing the title back to anfield.
their absence from the champions league has coincided with a tumultuous time both on and off the pitch for the blues, but under maresca the west london side may have found a formula of stability to earn them a spot in the top four behind arsenal.
performances in europe by english teams could dictate whether the premier league earns a fifth champions league spot.
according to opta, the three promoted sides in leicester, southampton and ipswich will be doomed for a direct return to the championship.
however, both palace and wolves are tipped to beat the drop this season, despite their respective poor starts.
while this table has the same top two as the predicted rankings, it suggests both fulham and tottenham should be in the top four.
a lucky ref - because nunez has scored.
asked if it felt like it could be goodbye given his place in amorim\'s new-look coaching staff is unclear, van nistelrooy said: no, i felt like closing this period down, if you say it like that.
basically it was a moment here and now, and that was the beauty of the moment in my opinion, where circumstances came together.
it could have been one or two games even, that was the first communication, and they kept me in the loop.
so, for me, it is important to have that clarity and i appreciated that.
in the end, the most important thing is this football club, and i'm here to support that in my role.
as i said, i want to continue doing that in the future and now also the communication was ok [that] 'after the block of four games, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues that are in an uncertain situation'.
what is important for me is that when i started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period, it was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85 per cent and put in little tweaks or changing players and resting players.
and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back.
you could see the quality of the players, still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve, but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four.
regarding his future at the club, asked if he would like to have been given the opportunity to show what he could have done in the role in the manner of ole gunnar solskjaer before him, he said: i appreciated the clear communication of the club.
for me, it was important to have that clarity.
for me the most important thing is the football club and i am here to support that and i want to continue that.
this cameo as a caretaker manager has been significant in its own way, already lifting the gloom.
three wins from four, the goals flowing once again, one can only wonder what erik ten hag makes of all this, no doubt telling himself that his team were on the cusp of this regardless, but the mood has changed.
these united fans know a thing or two about false dawns in recent years, even the dangers of believing the appointment of a former favourite in front of goal can change everything - but in that sense perhaps the club have finally got this one right.
rather than giving van nistelrooy a long-term contract as manager, he has performed his functioning in cleansing the spirit at old trafford, allowing everyone to look forward with optimism.
a defeat at old trafford even with manchester united so diminished would not ordinarily be enough to cause such fan frustration but steve cooper was on the receiving end of chants from the away end of 'cooper, sort it out' during the second half of the game.
the former nottingham forest boss has the foxes outside of the relegation zone on their return to the premier league but performances have not been fluent and a series of odd decisions at set plays seemed to infuriate the visiting supporters in manchester.
leicester could have leapfrogged united with victory in this game so clearly the margins are tight but they are now only three points from safety following ipswich's surprise win at tottenham.
sticking together is key but that looks difficult.
succeeding long-term managers is never easy, as the likes of manchester united and arsenal have discovered in recent years, but slot has taken to the role and responsibility like a duck to water.
liverpool have an embarrassment of riches in terms of their attacking talent but it is arguably the defence which deserves all the plaudits currently.
captain virgil van dijk and ibrahima konate have formed a formidable partnership in the centre of defence and have made life easy for their goalkeepers, whether that is alisson becker or caoimhin kelleher, with the club also tied for least shots on target faced at 36.
slot's side impress going forward but their early success has been built on a solid defensive foundation at the back.
while many teams would falter and panic with their three best players all on expiring deals at the end of the season, liverpool have not.
slot has continued to get the best out of veteran duo van dijk and salah, while a recent injury to alexander-arnold and his lack of form - with just one league assist to his name - could be considered the only concern.
the absence of hysteria surrounding the club is a credit to slot.
although i am a head coach now so sometimes it's convenient to say i'm a head coach and no longer a manager, so talk about contract situations with someone else!
i think in general, contract situations are about talking with the people who should talk about it.
i am one of them, but i should not talk about this in public.
as impressive as slot is at dealing with matters behind the scenes and addressing the media, his in-game management has arguably stood out in the early stages of his tenure.
whether it is a rallying call during the interval or wholesale changes for the second half, like he did to kick-start the 2-1 win against brighton, slot identifies issues within his team and addresses them without hesitation.
while other teams fall off as time goes on, liverpool only seem to get stronger.
no one expected liverpool to challenge for silverware this season - and it was not only because of the managerial change.
the 22-year-old is benefiting from working with his compatriot, who quickly identified gravenberch could thrive as a no 6 given his attributes and is thankful for his emergence as it meant the club did not have to recruit externally.
he is very comfortable with the ball, and i think that's what everybody saw, but not every manager, slot said regarding gravenberch.
you can bring a no 6 in that's only really good without the ball - hard tackles and sliding - which every fan loves, and a lot of pundits love as well.
or you look more at what can he bring for us if we have the ball, and i think he can help us a lot with the ball.
the reds came out of the clashes against united, arsenal and chelsea without a blemish on their record but will need to be at their very best if they are to maintain the impressive start in the immediate future.
liverpool responded to the shock loss to nottingham forest in september by winning 12 out of their next 13 matches across all competitions - but their upcoming run of fixtures will be the biggest test yet for slot.
it left spurs in another sticky situation up against a dogged and determined visitors who knew a storm was coming their way in the second half.
yet it never really materialised as only a rodrigo bentancur header found the net for underwhelming spurs, who struggled to create clear-cut chances although dominic solanke thought he had scored on 52 minutes but his effort was out by var for a handball.
they have seen their side lose five games already this season in the premier league as ange postecoglou is struggling to find the key.
the inconsistency we're having this year, ultimately it comes down to me and my approach and something i need to try and fix and see if i can help the players in that area.
i felt we didn't get the tempo or intensity right and then we gave ourselves a mountain to climb.
second half we were in the ascendancy and had opportunities obviously but we didn't do enough with them.
for the fans to see their club in the premier league and win in a stadium like this is a massive day.
this was a tactical masterclass by the impressive mckenna, who showed everyone why manchester united and chelsea were genuinely considering giving him the keys to their club in the summer.
they deserved this win.
a first-half performance full of guile and creative attacking play backed up by a backs-to-the-wall, dogged and clever second half where they restricted spurs to very little.
there is always going to be a problem that holds postecoglou from seriously succeeding at tottenham.
it revolves around the fact his team usually have to score two or more goals in a game to get a result.
tottenham's style means they are vulnerable via so many avenues.
and when the play turns over spurs offer so much space to wide forwards as szmodics found out during a performance that he'll remember for a long time.
spurs just couldn't deal with him in the first half.
but days like these just show how far they truly are away from being a contender.
it meant for the 10th time in 11 games, forest had scored the opening goal - but this time they were unable to hold onto their advantage as newcastle staged a spirited second-half fightback.
forest were left to rue a poor second-half performance as boss nuno espirito santo suffered the customary manager of the month curse after winning october's gong.
forest were on the back foot as half-time approached and newcastle thought they should have had a penalty when elanga went through the back of joe willock.
the visitors' dominance did leave them susceptible to forest's counter attack and nicolas dominguez could have made it two as he raced clear from chris wood's pass but pope saved with his feet.
i am very pleased even though we lost the game, i am very pleased and all of us at forest should be proud of our players and how we were working together, the portuguese said.
i would not say i'm frustrated, we lost the game, when you lose and win there is always a lesson to be learned, today we must learn some important lessons.
it's easy to see we have been punished by the way we have been punishing other teams.
i cannot say it is a bad performance, we have to give credit to newcastle, they are a good team who were able to control us and take advantage of some decisions we made.
so three wins and there is a totally different feel about the team.
i'm really pleased today because an away game, going 1-0 down to come back and win in the way that we did, i think is a big moment for us.
we probably don't want an international break at this moment in time but it's there and we have got an extended break as well because we play on the monday, not the saturday, when we come back.
for the first goal, isak makes it look so easy, but he just reacts well and gets a nice side foot and it just guides it into the corner.
it looks an easy chance, but you see a lot of players just slash at that, maybe kick it over the bar, but he's so calm, finishes it with aplomb.
it's so difficult for him at the moment because of anthony gordon's form, but he should really be, with his quality, playing regularly.
i think livramento makes this with his run.
i think it's a great run.
it's his run that takes the defender away and then it's easy.
great finish, but i think he makes the run.
running that 60, 70 yards for the overlap, takes the full-back away, gives him an opportunity as the lad comes across.
buoyed by city's slip, darwin nunez's first-half goal put arne slot's side on course for victory amid an excitable atmosphere and, though villa played their part in an entertaining contest, mohamed salah's breakaway goal sealed the points late on.
the victory, a 15th in 17 games for liverpool in all competitions, extends their lead at the top and offers hope that slot's first season could prove to be a spectacular one.
villa's set-piece coach austin macphee has received plenty of praise but liverpool almost scored from another corner for the away side, only for nunez to blaze over when one-on-one once more.
it was the difference because while morgan rogers spurned a good opening early in the second half and villa were chasing an equaliser late into the game, salah made no mistake when breaking clear to end any hope of a comeback - to anfield's delight.
it was not the perfect performance from slot's side, not the perfect night either with trent alexander-arnold going off injured before the interval, but there is a momentum to liverpool's season that arsenal and man city lack.
city might be expected to regroup during the international break, but that five-point lead brings belief.
maybe it will not need north of 90 points to claim this particular premier league title.
if so, 28 from 11 puts liverpool ahead of the game.
it is difficult to say how serious it is, but it's always serious if a player goes out in the first half, not because i didn't like him, but because he asked for it himself.
he didn\'t ask for it because he was tired, he asked for it because he got something, said slot.
that is first of all not a good sign, but it's always difficult so close after the game to tell you exactly what it is.
i would be surprised if we would see him playing for the england national team this week, but hopefully he can.
speaking in the press conference, emery felt aston villa should have had a penalty when conor bradley pulled the shirt of pau torres inside the 18-yard box.
with var, the action was clearly a penalty because he pulled shirt of pau torres.
i know in europe this is a penalty but here in england they want to use var… i don't know exactly.
i always accept the decisions of the referees but for me it was a clear penalty.
if we have the chance to shoot a penalty, maybe the result is different.
manchester city's blip turned into a crisis as brighton scored twice in five minutes late on to beat the champions 2-1 - and inflict a fourth straight defeat on city for the first time under pep guardiola.
but recently-injured duo joao pedro and matt o'riley - the latter on his delayed premier league debut after an ankle problem stuttered his summer move from celtic - stepped off the bench to send the amex stadium into raptures - not only costing city points in the title race, but taking fabian hurzeler's side into the top four, for a few hours at least.
four bad results, the second half, that is one of the worst halves of football i have seen from a pep guardiola side, they were abject, they did not defend, or win individual battles or pass the ball forward at times.
first half they were excellent, the problem was they should have been 3-0 up, but second half when hurzeler made the changes, there was only one team in it.
and once the game started to run away from you, then you are looking at characters, who is going to make that challenge and win that ball when you need it most?
they looked like a bunch of strangers and the goals they conceded summed it up, they were really poor goals from man city's point of view.
today we played really good in the first half, especially considering the opponent and what we created.
we could not keep the consistency of our game, our intensity, press and being aggressive for 90 minutes.
in the second half, we could not be more aggressive in these areas.
but i'm pretty sure when the players come back, we can make some individual qualities of the team and we will be back.
we have to change and be better to win.
we have to be in the position we are in the table.
i won't step back, more than ever i want to do it.
when i play bad, i'm the first to say i don't like it.
it's always important to have a big squad, one you can make subs where the players will have an impact.
the club should be happy and self-belief and self-trust away from this game that they're able to beat everyone - that they can beat the establishment.
at liverpool, we weren't good enough or intense enough to compete with the establishment.
mikkel damsgaard scored that equaliser, beating bournemouth goalkeeper kepa arrizabalaga at his near post on a shaky afternoon for the chelsea loanee, raising eyebrows about andoni iraola's decision to drop mark travers after two impressive stand-in displays.
brentford were second best until the opener but fought their way back into the game by becoming more physical, equalising through wissa's header at the back post after a long throw-in.
bournemouth boss andoni iraola was disappointed to lose at brentford, in a game he said went largely as they had planned for, and bemoaned the officials failing to give a penalty for a challenge on evanilson in the second half.
it's a hard one for us, because i'm very happy with the performance, especially in the first half.
in the second half, we couldn't make the difference.
probably the key moment is when we conceded after going up 2-1.
we have to manage these situations much better and they punished us, but our performance deserved much, much more today.
brentford boss thomas frank praised his side's free-scoring start to the season - they have the joint-most goals in the premier league on 22 - but acknowledged the need to improve defensively after conceding two or more for the fifth game running in the league.
maybe even more impressive than if we just had won 3-0 because we actually played bad the first 20 minutes.
bournemouth were better than us.
but after that goal we stepped up and we found some of that great bounce-back mentality.
maybe slightly up for us and we scored a fine goal.
second half we are clearly the best team on the pitch.
besides that, i think we gave nothing away in the second half and we are very dangerous going forward.
and the positive is that we are a very dangerous team going forward.
we must be up there [as a team that's scored the most goals].
i think that is insanely good.
i think people don't understand how good it is.
but of course, i am also very ambitious and i would love us to win 3-0 today.
bournemouth's last two impressive results, a 1-1 draw at aston villa and the 1-0 home win over champions manchester city, were in part thanks to the fine goalkeeping of deputy travers, standing in for the injured kepa.
but his player-of-the-match performance at villa park and a point-blank stop to keep out erling haaland in added time were not enough to convince iraola to keep him in the side at brentford, with kepa once again available after returning to fitness.
iraola's change, perhaps predictably, knowing kepa's frailties at dealing with crosses and brentford being one of the most direct teams in the premier league, shone an unwanted spotlight on the goalkeeping situation at bournemouth with the spaniard struggling.
kepa flapped at crosses throughout the game, and it was his inability to hold on to a ball into the box that led to brentford getting the throw-in from which wissa headed in a first-half equaliser.
but the most glaring of errors on a difficult afternoon for the chelsea loanee, signed for a world-record £71.6m fee for a goalkeeper from athletic bilbao in 2018, was his failure to cover his near post for damsgaard's equaliser in the second half.
iraola defended his goalkeeper in his post-match press conference, in which kepa was the most asked about topic, but even the head coach acknowledged he could have done better for brentford's second equaliser.
travers is banging on the door for kepa's job, and it is becoming harder and harder to ignore.
it was a killer blow, one that likely decided the game, turning the momentum on its head.
iraola was frustrated after the game because his side knew what was coming but could not stop it.
you have to be better than them.
o\'neil insisted he was comfortable in his own skin ahead of this fixture, but seeing sarabia round aaron ramsdale and fire his side into an early lead would have settled any nerves nonetheless.
the double setback of conceding early and seeing a goal disallowed did not deter russell martin's side from their usual approach.
it was clear to see why no other side in the division had scored fewer goals than their tally of seven thus far.
we lacked some quality but did not lack togetherness and fight.
disappointed with some of the quality shown but we did not set up to be free flowing and wanted to make sure we were excellent without the ball.
we should do more with the ball.
we should not take that for granted.
to be in the final third as much as we were, i would expect us to have something to show for it.
it is not good enough.
the only thing i am disappointed with is that we did not create more.
it is not enough.
when asked if he felt his job was secure following the loss, martin added: what will be, will be.
wolves have conceded more goals than any other side in the premier league - but they put that behind them for this crucial fixture.
as this performance shows, wolves have sufficient quality in the squad to threaten teams in this league through the likes of cunha and joao gomes.
scoring has never been the problem, it is shutting teams out which has caused them to plummet down the standings.
if they can build on this resilient defensive performance and carry it over into future fixtures, wolves will avoid relegation with ease.
no team has scored less than them in the premier league and this game showed exactly why.
in fact, despite having almost triple the amount of possession, saints recorded just one more touch than their opponents in the penalty area.
it is a statistic which only highlights the serious problem plaguing southampton.
goals are the only thing that will keep them in the premier league and without them, their fate could be decided relatively soon.
jose mourinho is targeting the manager's job at newcastle if eddie howe leaves st james' park.
ruud van nistelrooy has said he would like to take charge of manchester united on a permanent basis in the future but is committed to stay as an assistant to incoming head coach ruben amorim after a four-game spell in caretaker charge.
england have been accused of playing absolutely disgraceful versions of opposition anthems before kick-off as twickenham was criticised for a perceived lack of respect towards visiting teams.
steven naismith still believes he could have turned hearts' fortunes around.
brendan rodgers has warned he expects celtic to get even better after their champions league dismantling of rb leipzig.
the ex-wolves boss had been pragmatic in the manner he saved molineux from a return to the championship but with the promise of greater resources in london, there was hope this job would elicit more memories of his time in charge of sevilla where he won the europa league only four years ago, albeit in style more than silverware.
more than £130m has been spent on what appeared individually to be sensible signings - although they have produced little to justify the third-biggest net outlay across the premier league last summer.
everton's games with west ham have seemed to become obligatory win-or-bust games for both managers in the last few seasons, and this weekend's meeting the london stadium appears no different with newspaper rumours lopetegui could be replaced if they lose.
it is a remarkable situation given the optimism around east london less than three months ago that he could be out the door quicker than his ill-fated real madrid reign in 2018.
west ham's start to the season has been poor, but the glacial move towards the more progressive style desired has been his biggest hindrance.
he has long been a dependable face in midfield, but not a player an attacking manager would build their side around.
now 10 games in, it is still only jarrod bowen and mohammed kudus - far more creative players by nature - who can match his 40 opposition-box touches, and both have enjoyed more game time than he has this season.
fans are becoming frustrated by a lack of tangible progress, both from results and what they can see with their own eyes.
lopetegui insisted his philosophy is developing at the london stadium in the build-up to the everton game before caveating he has had to adapt to his players too.
but with lucas paqueta, mohammed kudus and jarrod bowen at his disposal, a trio who created 94 chances between them last season, this is not a team lacking in attacking creativity or technical ability.
paqueta racked up almost half of those chances himself but his drop in form represents one of the new head coach's biggest headaches.
he is the creative lynchpin he would want, but under lopetegui his chance creation has dropped by around a third, not helped by muddled tactical thinking from his new manager.
it took moyes time to get the best out of the brazilian but by last season, he had found home almost exclusively on the left flank.
this season he has drifted inside more, but has affected the game far less.
understandably he is beating his man barely half as much as he was, but in a role where he should be creating more, his expected assists have experienced a similar drop.
things were at their worst at nottm forest last weekend, where paqueta found himself the one making runs in behind the home defence to latch onto long balls forward from bowen.
he made more runs into the box than in any other game this season, but this should be bowen's job.
it was a strange role reversal and one which will not have helped lopetegui's attempts to win his players' trust in his methods.
a dynamic forward would help plug the gap it appears he is struggling to fill.
that makes the decision to bring in competition of a another player already in his 30s in niclas fullkrug even more of a gamble, doubly so on a four-year contract.
externally, the blame for west ham's transfer issues has been laid at the feet of technical director tim steidten, who despite a questionable recruitment record at the london stadium is said to be in the running for the vacant sporting director post at arsenal.
in mitigation, moyes' sway in his final season afforded him significant influence over transfers, and steidten found himself somewhat sidelined over incomings.
alvarez has shown promise in his time in london, but his disciplinary issues raise an increasing problem for the club given he will miss a fifth game through suspension in barely a season against everton on saturday.
that puts extra responsibility on rodriguez, who after a bright start has struggled - though he also took time to settle at his previous club betis.
it does not help that in the most physically demanding league in world football both he and soucek, who have started six of 10 league games together, rank in the 20 slowest midfielders in the premier league this season.
not that pace alone makes a good midfield.
but if west ham are going to control games and play further up the pitch, they will open themselves up to counter attacks and will need pace in transition.
even before that, dynamism in midfield - the kind declan rice used to provide - has been sorely missing since the start of last season.
that is a problem beyond lopetegui's making, but it is one he needs to fix.
the third centre-back also aimed to offer extra cover to the attacking remit lopetegui has handed his full-backs, who are ending up inside the opposition box almost twice as much as they were in moyes' last season.
ignoring the unusual decisions further forward, defensively there was some logic to it.
but lopetegui's players look devoid of confidence and belief as much as they do tactical understanding at this point.
unusually resolute for 45 minutes after taking an early lead, they collapsed once yves bissouma put them behind for the first time in the match and conceded three goals in eight minutes as their heads dropped.
facing an everton side with four points from five away games presents an opportunity to build that momentum, and a chance to move within touching distance of the top half.
but with a fragile mental state, key players absent in kudus and alvarez and a manager who doesn't appear to know his best team, that may prove easier said than done.
but the 39-year-old insisted he had no doubts about joining the red half of manchester.
if it is a very negative outcome, the expectations will drop.
if we win tomorrow, people will think the new sir alex ferguson has arrived - and that will be difficult to live up to!
it could increase expectations, it could lower them.
midfielder morten hjulmund, the captain amorim will leave behind next monday, spoke highly of his soon-to-be former boss - and his prospects in england - and revealed the level of influence he had over his own move to lisbon in 2023.
when you work with him, you get a clear picture of the way he sees football and how he sees you inside the team.
that picture is very important for a player when it's clear.
that was important when i joined the club, to understand the way he plays.
the way he manages the team on and off the pitch, is not anything i've seen before in my short career.
a key component for arsenal is finding someone who dovetails and works well in partnership with mikel arteta; the effectiveness of that relationship is felt to be linked to how strong arsenal can be.
while losing a sporting director mid-season and somewhat abruptly is not ideal, the club are calm about the situation.
there is a feeling edu that has installed a solid structure, with the ownership having shown a skill for hiring accomplished people in all key departments.
while arsenal have been understanding of edu's decision to depart for a wider remit, some staff are stunned by his choice of new role, despite his known friendship with evangelos marinakis.
part of the appeal for marinakis is that he respects the way edu conducts himself.
edu's excellent reputation - amongst peers, agents, players and managers - is also seen as pivotal to growing marinakis' stable of clubs.
marinakis understands the value of edu's expertise and esteem, and sky sports news understands the kind of figure being mooted as a potential salary would leave pep guardiola, arteta and unai emery as the only managers earning more than edu.
edu enjoys being challenged and he feels the scope of this role, which is effectively the role of group ceo role, will test him in new ways.
there is also a belief that his hardest work at arsenal is already done in terms of changing the culture, building healthy structures and an environment of excellence.
there is also the feeling that edu has helped turn arsenal from a punchline to title challengers, putting all the tools in place for the club to make the final step.
gary neville is still backing arsenal to win the premier league and says their current blip could inspire them to end their 21-year wait for the title.
i might look completely and utterly stupid and there'll be people playing this clip in three or four months saying, 'what the hell were you talking about?'
i always think about what a team needs to go through to win a title - manchester city aren't quite right, liverpool aren't perfect - sometimes you just need this little bit of a serious blip.
it's been a poor start for them really in terms of where we've expected them to be but they could get the players back post international break and go on a run.
he added: there is an element of arsenal just feeling a little bit sorry for themselves that they've got a few injuries.
jamie carragher is less confident about arsenal's chances but still counts them as contenders because of the difficult away schedule they have faced already this season.
carragher expects their next game against chelsea, another tough away trip, will be important for arsenal's chances in the title race, with a defeat potentially opening up the gap to the top even further.
he said: they're not out of the race, but i do think the weekend's game at chelsea is huge for them.
i think if they were to lose that game, and city and liverpool won, and then it's 10 points and eight points, i think that's a lot to make up.
if they could get a result at the weekend, and even if they went to chelsea and won, they have got a lot of big away games out the way at this early stage.
so if they could keep the deficit where it is now between liverpool and manchester city, i think it's five points and seven points, and they've played five or six of the real big teams away from home.
carragher says manchester city may need to sign a midfielder in january if they want to achieve their goals this season.
city, champions four years on the trot, are without rodri for the rest of the season through injury and carragher thinks pep guardiola does not have the players at his disposal to adequately make up for that loss.
in terms of mateo kovacic and ilkay gundogan in those positions, they're both the other side of 30, and i think it told a little bit at the weekend when you come up against a really energetic team in bournemouth, who are outstanding and fully deserved to win.
i think it would be really interesting if manchester city go back into the market in january, because i'm not sure, if those two stay in centre midfield between now and the end of the season, they can achieve what they want to.
despite his concerns about the midfield position, carragher still thinks city have the advantage in the title race.
i said manchester city at the start of the season, arsenal have dropped off a little bit from where i thought they would be, liverpool have probably exceeded expectations slightly, but i would still go with manchester city, he added.
guardiola warned ahead of the defeat at sporting that man city would struggle to overcome their mounting injury list.
guardiola handed a first senior start to defender jahmai simpson-pusey in lisbon to underline the issues he has, particularly at centre-back, where ruben dias and john stones are out injured.
i have to try to find an explanation but sometimes it's just football, so you have to accept it.
everyone has to try to be better and we will find it.
he has now gone two games without a goal and by the lofty standards he has set since arriving in england, that is a drought.
the worry for city is not regarding haaland and his form - as the goals will inevitably return for him - but the support he has around him.
five games back in 2023 is his longest run without a goal for the club but city still went undefeated throughout these fixtures, winning four and drawing one, as they leaned on the talents of julian alvarez, phil foden and many others in the squad.
the departure of alvarez, a drop in form for foden and injuries to other key players like rodri and de bruyne have now caused goals to dry up for those around haaland.
so if haaland struggles, the team now suffers more than ever.
bournemouth and tottenham were able to cause problems for city in the same way, but it has been happening throughout the season.
rodri's absence is a factor but it is worth noting that, before his injury, the spaniard started one of the games in which the issue was most apparent, the goalless draw with inter milan in september in which city gave up four shots from fast breaks.
the loss of the injured kyle walker's recovery pace is probably a bigger contributor.
but his struggles against fulham's adama traore, in a game city were lucky to win, added to the feeling that, at 34, he might not be the solution he once was behind their back line.
the root causes can be debated but city's frailty from fast breaks is an issue their opponents are exploiting with increasing regularity.
guardiola disagreed with bernardo sila's assertion that city are in a dark place after the sporting game, insisting their display was really good, despite the emphatic result.
that is not much comfort to city fans in the aftermath of such a heavy defeat but they remain on track for automatic qualification to the knockout stages, and the numbers support the argument that their performances have been better than their results suggest.
expected goal difference is regarded as a key performance indicator by clubs and offers hope to city that their fortunes could change.
his public disagreement with silva's post-match comments about the team being in a dark place could suggest so.
the only regret is conceding the third and fourth - the penalties were not necessary.
however, one positive is that this is city's final game before another international break, which could be a crucial two-week period for guardiola to get some of his injured stars back.
man city's squad will be severely tested in the coming weeks and it could be make or break for their season.
the agent started smiling but my father wasn't laughing and said, 'no, this is his mentality.'
when i left braga i used to get messages from everybody at the academy saying they were always watching me, that they liked the way i played, so i always felt loved by the people there who cared about me.
but his two years in rome brought just four serie a appearances under simone inzaghi, and neto admits he struggled to adapt to unfamiliar surroundings.
that was the biggest step, but i had my father and mother with me so it was really helpful because the times that i had there were tough.
it was a more different way of playing in italy than in the portugal and the people there were different.
a permanent move to england might not have seemed like the next logical step.
the portuguese players showed me how to work here and if i wasn't as sharp as i should have been they'd pick up on it, neto adds.
the way i saw joao moutinho playing, the way ruben neves spoke to me, it showed the values and character they have.
i'm thankful for the opportunity he gave me because he was the first one to give me a chance to show myself.
i felt that the premier league was the type of football that suited me well.
but after recovering from two hamstring injuries last season, the winger is convinced he is beginning to return to the sort of form that made him one of the most eye-catching talents in the premier league.
so, i came here and said to myself straight away that i had to take time.
i had to be strong mentally because through tough times with injuries i knew it would take time to get into the best shape, and here i am today working hard and trying to get into the best shape i can.
chelsea have regularly fielded the youngest average premier league starting xi this season, yet the determination to get results remains a priority.
of course we are really young but even in the last game [against manchester united] you saw we were not happy with that draw, neto insists.
the players have the mentality to win.
we knew we could have won that game and i think that mentality is important.
so with arsenal up next on sunday, does neto believe these are the big fixtures that enzo maresca's side will be judged on?
we had two games at home to nottingham forest and crystal palace, and if we want to be a top team we have to win those.
some games will be more difficult than others and these are the games we like to play, but if somebody says these are the games we are judged on, i don't think so.
a good thing with this group is that we go with the same mentality for all the games.
the key point is the consistency, that is the point of everything.
he smiles when asked if this mentality borders on an obsession.
every time i arrive home i like to speak with my girlfriend and say what it is i have to do to improve, that kind of stuff, he explains.
i'm okay with that, i love the way you play it, but sometimes we just have to take your head away from football!'
if this chelsea team is to recapture former glories, it is a mindset that could serve them well for years to come.
i think we demand him a lot because i think he can give a lot, and today probably he scores and everyone gives him more recognition.
semenyo's showing coupled with the victory justified iraola's surprise move to switch his winger to the left for this game.
it was more defensive minded because we decided the job defensively that the right winger had to do was more difficult.
while marcus tavernier focused on that, semenyo was free to cause problems for city.
not that his own defensive work is unimpressive.
in this form, perhaps it is no surprise that liverpool have been linked with a move for him.
but when trying to explain what makes him special, this is not it.
ballon d'or winner rodri may have the most touches of anyone on the pitch but in the box, it is salah who is still king.
if he can continue to defy the ageing process and find ways of creating space for himself in there, expect the magic moments to keep coming.
there were times last season when caicedo appeared burdened by that £115m fee that brighton were paid for his services, seemingly dragged down by the malaise at stamford bridge.
because he was so good at brighton, that does not mean that when he joins chelsea he is automatically going to be as good as he was at brighton.
his quick-fire double was crucial as tottenham came from behind to beat top-four rivals aston villa 4-1.
the goals delighted ange postecoglou, but the spurs boss has consistently talked up the importance of his all-round contribution to the side and that was his message again.
just unbelievable, he said of solanke's work-rate in the game, this display coming only a few days after a similarly industrious performance in the carabao cup win over manchester city.
his effort was evident throughout as he hounded and harried villa defenders and it was reflected in premier league tracking data which showed he made 36 high-intensity sprints - the second-highest total by any player in a premier league game all season.
manchester united, not for the first time this season, might have taken more from this game if their shooting had been sharper.
there was hope that ruud van nistelrooy's presence in the dugout might inspire goals, as seen against leicester, but that was not the case here.
four big chances compared to chelsea's one was surely enough to see them over the line, even if their performance was not that of a side that clearly merited three points.
alejandro garnacho and bruno fernandes particularly will feel they should have done better against chelsea.
the other troubling takeaway from the game against chelsea was the failure to supply striker rasmus hojlund, whose only touch in the opposition box came when he won the penalty for fernandes in the second half.
united's finishing is one of the more alarming aspects of their game this season, considering how they rank to the rest of the premier league.
no side has a worse big-chance conversion than united, who are missing 81 per cent of such opportunities.
if you can't stop him, kick him.
that's the message opposition teams are dishing out to cole palmer as they try to stop a player that has quickly become one of the most dangerous in world football.
manchester united were the latest team to do a job on chelsea's playmaking sensation, fouling him four times in the 1-1 draw - two of the fouls led to yellow cards and in the case of lisandro martinez, he was a lucky boy to stay on the pitch after his ugly challenge aimed at palmer's knee cap - thankfully for all concerned - lacked connection.
however, another loss to a north london side may be the product of an emerging trend for villa that may be cause for some concern.
the spaniard was adamant after the spurs game that the first target remains a top-seven finish.
it's not enough, but we are still in the top-seven positions and this is the first objective we can try to keep.
i am not really worried about the result because it could happen, with how the match was going.
however, within the fact that villa have growing issues against some of the top sides they've impressed in the champions league, sitting top of the table with a 100% record after three games, conceding none in their return to the competition after over four decades.
the second-half collapse against tottenham was the latest audition for the two forwards to show they can function together as a partnership.
it marked the 10th time the two villa forwards had shared the field in the premier league this season, with duran featuring off the bench more than any other player so far (10), and the lack of cohesion was clear to see once again.
villa's record with both strikers on the pitch is respectable with five wins, three draws and two losses - but it is the underlying levels of production from each player that will be keeping emery up at night.
the pair are yet to assist each other and 60 per cent of the goals scored with both forwards on the pitch occurred during the 3-1 win against wolves, which saw gary o'neil's side collapse late on.
disrupting the flow of the team as a whole is another issue, as the loss to tottenham clearly highlighted.
villa have nearly conceded as many goals (four) as they have scored (five) when emery has decided to trial the pair together.
it prompts a lack of balance in the team and suppresses their individual qualities - but why?
playing two strikers is rare to see in the modern game and villa have shown why so far.
in contrast, rogers offers a more complementary heat map to watkins, as he looks to drop deeper to collect the ball and drive his team forward.
the england u21 international stumbled into the role of second striker this season but emery has also utilised others, such as youri tielemans and john mcginn, with the same assignment: occupy the space behind the striker, drag defenders out of position and create space for watkins to thrive in.
meanwhile, duran's priorities are more in line with his counterpart, as both look to maximise their chances of scoring.
the root cause of the improved defensive numbers with the england international leading the line could correlate to his work-rate off the ball.
duran's numbers are slightly lower and could hint as to why villa are more susceptible to conceding when he replaces watkins in the line-up.
these figures might also highlight why emery continues to opt for watkins as his first choice in the role, despite the strong numbers off the bench from his teammate.
the villa boss is well aware that the experiment is yet to work but insisted he will keep giving watkins and duran the chance to thrive together, as he searches for a solution to his striker conundrum.
speaking after the loss to tottenham he was asked why he chose to play the two together, saying: because it is a possibility.
i have to try to give minutes to those players on the field and how we can get better with those players.
we have to give them chances to get confidence.
the same experiment was trialled on several occasions when danny ings was in the second city from 2021 to 2023 and it eventually led to the striker being squeezed out of emery's plans in the january transfer window.
villa were a worse side during this time frame but the same issues presented themselves, as the lack of cohesion up front sent reverberations throughout the team as a whole.
villa will be hoping to avoid a similar situation with duran but the 20-year-old forward has been honest about his lack of patience.
sporting director monchi claimed no less than 40 clubs registered an interest in duran throughout the summer and the list will have only grown given his strong showings across all competitions.
both players are tied down to long-term contracts and both deserve a regular role in the starting line-up.
roy keane has warned incoming head coach ruben amorim that manchester united are average at everything following their drab 1-1 draw with chelsea.
he should have signed a longer contract, said keane when asked about amorim's appointment.
'boring' seems a bit strong but they lack conviction.
you look at certain individuals and they think they're better than they are.
whenever you see a manager go you have to take some of the blame on yourself, it is because the team is not doing so well.
it is easier to get rid of a manager than 15 players.
i wasn't scoring goals, we are not scoring goals and i feel responsible.
i wouldn't have much time for players saying they let you down - it's too little, too late, he said.
you are judged on what you do on the football pitch and bruno hasn't been doing enough in a lot of the games, not showing leadership.
players don't really care when a manager goes, they are just concentrating on the next one coming in - they are looking after themselves, players can be selfish.
i don't think bruno has done enough in the last few years as captain of manchester united to help the manager out, far from it.
it's not just bruno but i don't think he's shown enough leadership skills.
he shouldn't be too proud of himself about what has happened in the last week.
liverpool's comeback win at brighton ensured they established themselves at the summit, at city's expense.
it's very difficult to beat city.
to beat them deservedly is even more difficult and even if we suffered until the end, i think we deserved this one.
you have to enjoy it because you know it's not going to happen a lot.
we could not match up the intensity of bournemouth, who had six or seven days.
we talked about that, we had to increase our duels in that position.
and we had our momentums, but the long balls, we could not defend them and when that happens, you have to defend so deep.
after nine years together, i know they gave it but not enough to compete against that team in that moment.
it's not just about that, but when you are in that position you have to do more in concentration and win a little bit more.
we knew bournemouth have success in this part of the season and it's well deserved.
in other circumstances we could have defended our unbeaten record.
mikel arteta's side were trailing for much of the encounter after isak powered anthony gordon's excellent cross beyond david raya, and they were flat throughout against their physically dominant and defensively formidable hosts.
ethan nwaneri was brought off the bench after hisimpressive performance at prestonin midweek but the 17-year-old was unable to turn the tide.
in truth - as at bournemouth - arsenal were crying out for the creativity of their injured captain, martin odegaard.
when you create three big chances in the game, you are hoping to score a goal because it is about the fine margins we are always discussing, said manager arteta after the game.
but the team should have generated more, that's my responsibility.
but credit must also go to newcastle, who were back to something close to their best after five league games without a win.
they move up to eighth - just three points behind their visitors, who cannot afford many more performances like this.
we started the game really well, we were on top of it, we looked sharp and alive and the one action: direct play, second ball, ball out wide - they're so good at that - unbelievable shot and finish.
then the energy shifts, you know the game they want to play is clear.
you too often get dragged into that kind of game, we couldn't find the answers to get out of that.
but not enough threat to say we could really change the game and win it.
today we weren't our best version.
i didn't feel that [the players were feeling fear or anxiety].
what i did feel is we lacked more purpose and more threat, more capacity to really go and help them.
mikel arteta said before the game his arsenal team thrive when they show their teeth.
the gunners created 1.11 expected goals, so should have found the net at st james' park.
for long periods of the game, arsenal failed to break down newcastle's mid-block and they were missing something.
it appears that if arsenal have any ambitions to win the premier league title, or even challenge for it, then martin odegaard needs to return from injury quickly.
odegaard would have provided that killer touch arsenal missed at newcastle.
it was a low game on chance-creation today, neither team created an abundance of goalscoring opportunities, but that comes down to the quality of the sides and how difficult it was to break our defensive line or their defensive quality.
one moment of quality wins the game and it's fine margins in the premier league.
initially, the results didn't come, now we have to make sure that level stays.
it wasn't necessarily the path or the game we envisaged it would be, but we had to adapt.
the second half, we had to be smart with what we did.
a big credit to everybody in how they defended the goal.
this was the kind of newcastle performance that has made eddie howe's side such a tough nut to crack during most of his time in charge - and also served to remind us what they had been missing during a five-game winless run.
the magpies had been too easy to run through, too easy to score against and too easy to overpower for much of this campaign.
newcastle seem to relish taking on arteta's side, embracing the opportunity to frustrate, battle and bruise their title-chasing opponents.
maintain this level, and howe's outfit will be back in the mix for the top four.
but i was told it was not possible, i was told it was now or never, or manchester united would go for another option.
there's a time when i have to take a step forward.
it was harder for me than for any sporting fan but i had to do this.
there was a club that said that if i rejected it now in six months i wouldn't get it, and i knew that in six months i will leave sporting, so i did not want to regret not making this decision.
i know it was a disappointment to the sporting fans and not take the risk or wait for the end of the season, and then i wouldn't have the only club i wanted to coach.
the president knows about this because i had other offers and i didn't want them before, but this one i did want so i made my decision.
but now i go home more happier because i have explained.
people say 'it's about the money', but there was another team that that wanted to hire me before and they paid three times more than manchester.
amorim insisted man utd will not sign sporting players - including in-demand striker viktor gyokeres, who scored four goals against estrela on friday - in the january transfer window
amorim had gyokeres to thank for more than just the four goals tonight - the striker lifted the atmosphere around the place.
when sporting parted with €10m (£8.4m) to recruit a head coach without a uefa pro licence and with only three months of top-flight experience on his cv from braga in 2020, it was termed absolute insanity.
the scathing reaction from the club's fans and analysts in portugal are still stored on message boards - the internet, after all, never forgets - and paints a sharp contrast to the sentiment now.
back then, sporting's hierarchy were ridiculed for sanctioning such a big spend on an unknown quantity.
this week, as manchester united sacked erik ten hag and turned at the speed of light to amorim, that same figure was a lightning rod for sporting's decision-makers: how dare they set the fee so low for the biggest clubs in world football to steal their special one?
the 39-year-old will be priceless to united if he delivers what they are convinced he has the ability to: a transformation of tactical identity, personality and proper football enjoyment.
also in away games, it gave the team and me an incredible feeling to hear the united chants taking over the opponents' stadiums, whether the game was in england, europe or during the summer tours.
that's what makes united supporters so special.
our shape was good, our play was good, we made enough chances away from home to win the game.
i know their defender, i don't think he's that quick to get around him from there but we don't get those big decisions often.
it's not only a sloppy goal, we should have scored at the other end.
we had plenty of desire to get back and they got that out of nothing at that stage of the game.
we scored a goal, which comes from their attacking set play and amazing composure in our box.
it starts there with the guys not just clearing the ball and staying so brave.
i'm really grateful to the boys for sticking through some tough moments today as well as sticking with what we want to be and who we want to be.
wood has now netted eight goals in his last eight appearances for club and country, as he continues to stake his claim as serious opposition to manchester city forward erling haaland in the race for the golden boot.
i think all of us should be proud of the way we performed, we started the game well and controlled their threat while being positive going forward.
the red card changed everything but the players understood not to be complacent.
wood has transformed himself into one of the most lethal strikers in the top flight of english football and the team have ascended into the top three of the premier league.
they have heaps of quality surrounding their in-form striker and showed that through hudson-odoi, aina and the talent they called upon from the bench.
you would be naive to think this was just a purple patch of form, we've seen that teams like aston villa can challenge top teams for champions league football - so why can't forest be the latest to do this?
the upcoming meetings against newcastle and arsenal will be crucial in determining what the ceiling for this team really is.
second half we had to change our plan and think about how we can face the game.
if we did not suffer the second goal, we could have drawn the match.
we have to use this bad moment to push us up and forward.
we have to compete better and be more consistent.
it is about consistency and we need that.
we have to become a better team, for sure.
we have a lot of good players and we can do better.
this is a moment we have to stick together and to recognise we can all do better defensively.
in the early stages of the game, it looked as if the combination of max kilman, jean-clair todibo and konstantinos mavropanos could keep the in-form wood quiet after he was limited to just eight touches in the first 25-minutes.
lopetegui was quick to point out after the game that the result did not solely fall on the shoulders of alvarez and instead looked at his team as a collective by insisting they must be better across all fronts.
if they are to prevent this season from petering out into mid-table mediocrity - or something much worse - they have to improve across all areas.
when sporting parted with €10m (£8.4m) to recruit a head coach without a uefa pro licence and with only three months of top-flight experience on his cv from braga in 2020, it was termed absolute insanity.
the scathing reaction from the club's fans and analysts in portugal are still stored on message boards - the internet, after all, never forgets - and paints a sharp contrast to the sentiment now.
back then, sporting's hierarchy were ridiculed for sanctioning such a big spend on an unknown quantity.
this week, as manchester united sacked erik ten hag and turned at the speed of light to amorim, that same figure was a lightning rod for sporting's decision-makers: how dare they set the fee so low for the biggest clubs in world football to steal their special one?
the 39-year-old will be priceless to united if he delivers what they are convinced he has the ability to: a transformation of tactical identity, personality and proper football enjoyment.
it has long been inevitable that ruben amorim would take one of europe's biggest jobs.
repeating the feat last season only underlined his ability as a coach.
they bet on his tactical mind, his fierce commitment as a player, but more than anything on the power of his personality.
in conversation with a series of portuguese coaches, some of whom have pitted their wits against amorim in his native country, we will explore his rise, what it is that makes him so impressive as a coach, and, crucially, whether this can be translated into his next job.
it's the first time man utd have had a 'head coach', which tells you more about modern football than man utd.
the head coach is just another hire, but of course when it comes to the football side of the operation, is the most important hire.
they decided to stick with ten hag in the summer, and looking back they'd say that was wrong.
hindsight is a wonderful thing, ineos realised they made a mistake and that they were in danger of missing out on the top four.
they realised they had to make a quick change, and credit to them - they've done just that.
when ruben amorim arrives at carrington on november 11 to begin work as man utd boss, the hope will be the team has momentum and confidence from their premier league home game with leicester the day before.
certainly, the portuguese will want to hit the ground running in terms of performances and results to get off on the right foot - who can forget erik ten hag's start, when a 2-1 loss at home to brighton was followed by a 4-0 humbling at brentford?
those early games could set the tone for what is to come in the remainder of the season - a fast start feels crucial.
i asked ruud van nistelrooy if he believed he would remain at the club when the new manager was appointed and he said his contract is to be the assistant manager of man utd and that's what his role will revert to when his interim period ends.
i was listening to what jamie carragher was saying earlier on and i would like to stress this... because he said something very interesting in relation to manchester united giving managers too much power.
one of the main topics he discussed with united prior to signing the contract was he wanted to make sure how far he would have an influence on his signings.
he is a very hands-on manager and he doesn't settle for what clubs give him - even at a powerhouse like united.
i don't think [man city's incoming director of football] hugo viana is going to miss him, even though they are the best of friends and one is going to man city and the other is going to united because when he wants a player, it won't be any different now he is at united.
there has been speculation over some players not fitting into his system and even being sold in january, but one thing i can tell you is that i think bruno fernandes will have an even bigger role.
i can't tell you which players will thrive but i think they will enjoy his training.
ruben amorim has done amazing work at sporting - but managing manchester united is five steps up, says sky sports\' paul merson.
merson has been impressed by the two-time title winner but says the pressure at united will be a whole new challenge for amorim.
we've seen it with ten hag: brilliant at ajax, come to man utd, win one, draw one, lose one and you're under pressure.
will amorim be different to the managers who have gone before?
he's managed in portugal, done everything right, his team did very well against arsenal last year.
we've seen with all these managers, you're under severe pressure every game.
as a football team they're nowhere near those heights.
i can't emphasise enough how far they are behind the big boys at the moment.
merson says the scale of the task facing amorim - with united currently seven points off the top four - means qualifying for the champions league is almost out of reach.
in fact, merson believes it would be a stunning season of coaching from the incoming boss if he were to deliver a top-four finish this term.
you could put pep guardiola in charge of man utd and he couldn't turn it around that much.
they have to build and build whereby in three to four years time united are back where they should be, fighting for premier league titles.
if they get top four he'd have pulled up trees and should get knighted by our king!
merson says amorim's priority when he arrives is to coach the players into a clear style of play, something he believes ten hag never achieved during his tenure.
i don't think anyone could sit there and tell me what man utd were trying to do.
there are going to be some great times in the next two or three months where they play scintillating football and win games but it's going to be up and down.
i'm trying to think who he brought in who was a major success.
they will need pace at the back [to play amorim's preferred 3-4-3].
rasmus hojlund is a young lad and joshua zirkzee hasn't been given much time yet but they need a goalscorer.
english stadium safety worries have been raised as the family of a fan who died following a fall at southampton called in police after learning the club were allegedly warned for years to install handrails.
manchester united reportedly asked high-profile pundits to stop praising jadon sancho during the winger's loan stint at borussia dortmund.
under-fire rangers boss philippe clement will be left teetering on the brink of the sack if his side slip up at hampden this weekend, according to former ibrox star billy dodds.
st mirren's jaden brown, who drove while banned faces the prospect of being tagged if he doesn't stay out of trouble, a court has warned.
as a big part of the being the manchester united manager is being used to the spotlight in good times and bad times - and he is clearly good at that, speaking perfect english.
it would appeal to anyone's ego to work for united.
it has long been inevitable that ruben amorim would take one of europe's biggest jobs.
repeating the feat last season only underlined his ability as a coach.
they bet on his tactical mind, his fierce commitment as a player, but more than anything on the power of his personality.
in conversation with a series of portuguese coaches, some of whom have pitted their wits against amorim in his native country, we will explore his rise, what it is that makes him so impressive as a coach, and, crucially, whether this can be translated into his next job.
the holding midfielder has to think for the rest of the team and not expect the recognition.
without him, we could not do what we are doing.
not for him the claim of trent alexander-arnold that the ballon d'or is the prize he most craves.
if you defend well, you will attack better.
so when i look at individual awards and see only the guys who score goals winning, i feel a bit like it does not represent our sport that well.
in truth, he was arguably even better in the previous season, instrumental in manchester city's historic treble and scoring the winning goal in the champions league final.
named as the best player at euro 2024, it feels part of a belated realisation that this is the man responsible for getting the best teams playing - at club and international level.
but rodri is such a presence that he is hard to ignore.
his metronomic use of the ball makes the game look easy.
he receives passes under such pressure that a lesser player would be horrified to be expected to do anything whatsoever with it.
tracking data allows us to calculate how difficult the passes that players attempt are based on the location of the opposition.
it might seem as if rodri's passes are simple but there are so many he should lose it a lot.
his passing is more ambitious than he makes it look.
the number of chipped passes being so much higher than any other player might seem just a stylistic quirk but it is revealing in its own way.
no premier league player won possession of the ball more times in the middle of the pitch and that ability to snuff out the counter-attacks helps to explain why city were so alarmed when he suffered his serious injury.
with him we are a better team.
the amount of things that he helps to do, he is irreplaceable right now, i would say.
but amorim insists he remains focused on wanting sporting to become double winners of the league and cup.
when everything hasn't been decided, one way or the other, there's no point in talking much more, because otherwise we'll create noise.
amorim did admit that if he was to leave, his players would be disappointed with him leaving halfway through a season.
now i talk to the players, because i'm sporting coach.
but without a doubt my players will be, if i leave, they will be disappointed in me and sad with me.
and they were a little disappointed, because they really believed that we were building something special.
and the important thing is that we reach the end and know how to explain everything.
whether people understand it or not, the important thing is to come forward and explain it.
a big part of the being the manchester united manager is being used to the spotlight in good times and bad times - and he is clearly good at that, speaking perfect english.
he's a family man, not a 247 football man which could be an issue if he's going to take the united job.
it would appeal to anyone's ego to work for manchester united.
it has long been inevitable that ruben amorim would take one of europe's biggest jobs.
repeating the feat last season only underlined his ability as a coach.
they bet on his tactical mind, his fierce commitment as a player, but more than anything on the power of his personality.
in conversation with a series of portuguese coaches, some of whom have pitted their wits against amorim in his native country, we will explore his rise, what it is that makes him so impressive as a coach, and, crucially, whether this can be translated into his next job.
i am not going to speak about my future because no matter what i say i'd have to always talk about it.
since the first day, i said it was not worthy to ask about it and i am not going to make any comments about my future.
despite batting away the question of whether he is in the frame to get the old trafford job during a press conference after ten hag's sacking, it is understood amorim would relish the challenge of coaching united.
one of the stumbling blocks to this deal being done is the fact that he's got this release clause in his contract.
united have to comply with psr rules and they have to also pay off erik ten hag so there's talk they will have to pay him the region of £15m.
so united would need to spend not only to sack ten hag but also to bring in amorim.
his brand of football is attractive but some detractors would say what he has achieved has been over a very short period of time in portuguese football.
with all due respect, the level of the portuguese league is not at the same level as others in europe.
but it looks like amorim could be the next big portuguese manager.
it has long been inevitable that ruben amorim would take one of europe's biggest jobs.
repeating the feat last season only underlined his ability as a coach.
they bet on his tactical mind, his fierce commitment as a player, but more than anything on the power of his personality.
in conversation with a series of portuguese coaches, some of whom have pitted their wits against amorim in his native country, we will explore his rise, what it is that makes him so impressive as a coach, and, crucially, whether this can be translated into his next job.
the challenge is to continue to demand the same because nothing changes.
in an era in which almost every coach talks of pressing high, forest don't do it.
passes allowed per defensive action - commonly known as ppda - became the metric of choice to describe the intensity of those teams determined to win the ball quickly.
while it can feel like passing out from the back has been fetishised by a generation of coaches, becoming an end in itself rather than a means to an end, the goal that saw off leicester came from a long, straight ball over the top to their target-man chris wood.
but if i tell you, honestly, am i not showing my biggest strength?
me, by not telling you, i am not showing that i am smart.
the onus is not on him to explain why he plays this way - the results do that.
there is ordinarily a correlation between the two but nuno's team buck that trend.
forest do not press high but that does not mean they simply defend deep.
instead, they often choose to operate with a mid-block because it is there, not higher, that they want to win the ball back.
in that zone, there is space for their speedy wingers to run into that would not exist if they gained possession close to the opposition goal.
the positioning of the forest forwards helps to cut off certain passing lanes and encourages others.
while his wolves team preferred to force the opposition wide, the emphasis has changed across the premier league with sides now looking to transition from central zones.
it is there, in the congested middle, that forest force teams to pass.
as the van dijk example illustrates, this is the secret of nuno's success.
not to press the opposition but to suck them where they want them, controlling the ball's circulation even out of possession.
it requires a lot of work to do this well, players who can maintain high levels of concentration and who are constantly aware of the spaces.
perhaps that explains why the small details were not quite right last season following nuno's arrival in december.
it made him uncomfortable because he knew the level of work it takes to get this football right without the ball.
without a pre-season, you just inherit something, another vision, and that is hard, especially for me.
when you have a chance to be one month together, and for two of those weeks, almost 80 per cent of your day is spent together, on the training pitch, at meals, in meetings, you get to know the player better.
once you understand their behaviours, then, because you understand them better, you can understand which buttons you should push in the right moment.
when they are very tired, almost dead, that is when you really know how far a guy is willing to go, when he is hot, sweating, and now he wants water, but you make him go on.
these simple things, if you pay attention to them, show a lot about the character.
when a player is not in the team but he is still there giving advice to a player in the same position because he wants the best for the team, he is not thinking of himself, this is something that i value a lot, he explains.
when you are in the heat of competition, and there is all this noise around, you just do not have proper time to deal with that aspect.
this is something that you can only build when you have time, and the environment is ready, and pre-season was good for that.
these are exciting times, not least because forest look as likely to beat the very best as they do the rest.
nuno is achieving it his way, not following the trends but maximising his resources and outperforming expectations again.
wolves head coach gary o'neil has been reprimanded by the football association but escaped punishment after insinuating referees operated with a bias towards bigger clubs.
despite not being quoted among the bookmakers' leading candidates to take over as the next manchester united manager, gary lineker has suggested that the left-field appointment of lee carsley would be very interesting.
manchester united have made ruben amorim their no.1 choice to replace the sacked erik ten hag.
whisky veteran billy walker has opened the door to investing in rangers - but the sums the diehard can throw at the club look set to be limited by uefa.
gary neville believes it was a lack of clear playing style that was the root of the problems for erik ten hag at manchester united and ultimately led to his dismissal.
the recruitment has been awful at times but i believe there are a group of players who can play better than they are.
lack of style has been the biggest problem.
that has been as bad as the results.
neville believes the writing was on the wall for ten hag when his side were beaten 3-0 at home to tottenham at the end of september.
i suspect the tottenham game was probably a catalyst for them to start thinking about a new manager, said neville.
you are half hoping the manager can turn it around but, 99 times out of 100, the tide is against you and continues to do so.
looking at that tottenham game a few weeks ago i felt i had seen this before.
on sunday the missed chances were unacceptable, they should have been two or three up at half-time.
overall, the challenges of the results and performances have meant that the owners have decided to sack him.
however, neville believes his former team-mate can only have a limited impact during his interim spell at the helm.
he can set up the team differently but he has been on the bench with erik ten hag.
a lot of work needs to be done with these players as they have been struggling.
he will do his very best and i have thought they may be better suited going three at the back - maybe that will give them more comfort.
neville says the current group of players can perform far better than they are, though - and additions in january are not required to improve the team.
no-one watches united and doesn't think the players are better than what they are showing.
they are better than 14th and probably better than sixth, he said.
united have been in this position many times, you begin to question every player on the pitch.
if a manager can come in and start to get a song out of them, you can start deciding who to keep.
the new manager should be made to work with these players.

joelinton has been a premier league ever-present for newcastle this season.

with nine victories, one draw and only a single defeat, slot's liverpool have conceded the least in the league this season and have scored the joint-third most goals thus far.
in doing so, slot would become the fifth manager to win the premier league in their maiden season.
but despite a stunning start, liverpool's title bid is anticipated to yield the least amount of points a champion has earned for nearly 10 seasons.
with 85 points predicted as the total return for the reds, they wouldn't make the top two in 50 per cent of the last eight seasons.
liverpool are forecast to pip manchester city who are in second while arsenal, who are hoping to end a two-decade-long wait for league glory, are in third in the predicted table.
chelsea, who currently sit third in the premier league, are predicted to make a return to europe's elite competition.

former premier league referee dermot gallagher is back to assess the controversial moments from the weekend's action.
ruud van nistelrooy expects clarity on his future by the end of monday after his interim reign as manchester united manager ended with a 3-0 win against leicester and a special old trafford send-off.
having seen his goal-laden first spell as a united player come to an acrimonious end in 2006, the fan favourite returned to the club over the summer as one of erik ten hag's assistants.
van nistelrooy stepped up as interim boss following ten hag's sacking and hands over to new head coach ruben amorim having ended his temporary stint with a much-needed league victory against leicester.
the old trafford faithful chanted the dutchman's name from the outset and throughout the match, with things coming to an emotional crescendo as he went around applauding the fans at full-time.
after this block of four games, it felt like closure for that period and the future is open, van nistelrooy said.
that's the way i felt it.
it was a beautiful moment to be able to share that with the supporters and special.
it was a beautiful moment and it was gratitude from my side to them, and the reception i was able to receive was unbelievable so i can only thank them.
amorim starts work at old trafford on monday, having led sporting lisbon for the final time in their league match against braga on sunday night.
the portuguese has already confirmed he will be bringing in his own staff, raising doubt over whether van nistelrooy will still be an assistant at a club he has a deal with until 2026.
i appreciated the clear communication of the club that it was an interim spell for a short term, the temporary boss said.
they said 'ok, it's going to be four, it's going to be announced a new head coach', etc, etc.
so, i expect to hear today or tomorrow from them.
old traffordattendance:attendance73,829.
ruud van nistelrooy signed off with a win as manchester united powered to a 3-0 win over leicester city at old trafford.
bruno fernandes' fine finish from outside the box opened the scoring on the occasion of his 250th appearance for the club and the captain helped double the advantage when his effort was deflected into the net for an own goal by victor kristiansen before the break.
there was time for another spectacular goal from distance in the second half when alejandro garnacho emerged from the bench to curl the ball into the top corner with fernandes the architect once more.
the goals are finally flowing again for united.
leicester had the odd moment, andre onana saving from wilfred ndidi, but the result makes it three wins and a draw from van nistelrooy's four games before he hands over to ruben amorim.
united are 13th in the table.
the foxes stay down in 15th.
i can only describe that moment, how i felt and as a closure of this block of four games, it felt like a closure and the future is open.
that is the way i felt it.
it was a beautiful moment to be able to share that with the supporters, it was special.
asked if it was goodbye, he added: no, i felt like closing this period down and it was a moment, here and now and that was the beauty of the moment and where circumstances came together and it was a beautiful moment.
gratitude from my side to them and the reception i was able to receive was unbelievable.
it was an interim spell for a short term, it could have been one or two games, they kept me in the loop.
it was four.
also the communication was after the block of four, there will be communication.
expect to hear today or tomorrow on that.
the stretford end roared his name as he left the pitch, van nistelrooy receiving another rousing ovation in the stadium where he was once such a hero as a player.
the handover to amorim now comes with hope.
whatever happens next, this was a special day for him and the fans.
the grumbles are growing.
the victory against aston villa was the latest chance for slot's team to stake their claim for silverware this year and they did so in emphatic style.
goals from darwin nunez and mohamed salah secured all three points at anfield, as liverpool opened up a five-point gap on last year's champions manchester city.
the reds have only conceded six goals throughout the opening 11 games and have kept six clean sheets, which is more than any other side so far.
in both the public eye and on the pitch, the reds have not shown any signs of trepidation regarding the possibility that they could lose van dijk, salah and trent alexander-arnold for free at the end of the campaign.
it would be strange if i have no input, he said when asked about the latest contract developments.
i do talk about this with [sporting director] richard [hughes] and that's the place where we have to talk about it and not in front of a microphone.
prior to the win against villa, liverpool had been drawing or losing in all of their last four fixtures but went on to secure seven points and a spot in the carabao cup quarter-finals from these games.
the reds have now scored 23 goals and conceded just five in the second half across all competitions this season.
incoming georgia goalkeeper giorgi mamardashvili and italy winger federico chiesa were the only signings made by the club in the summer, which meant wataru endo remained the lone defensive midfielder in the squad heading into the 202425 campaign.
or so they thought.
netherlands midfielder ryan gravenberch has since enjoyed a meteoric rise into the liverpool first team and is just one start away from equalling his premier league tally from last season.
so, it's a bit of a choice.
and he has a good tackle.
liverpool's start to the season has not been easy - but it is set to ramp up in the coming weeks.
tottenham hotspur stadiumattendance:attendance61,505.
ipswich recorded their first premier league win of the season with a shock 2-1 win over sloppy and lacklustre tottenham.
ipswich raced into a first-half lead courtesy of sam szmodics' clever overhead kick and liam delap's close-range finish.
spurs were booed off by their home fans at full-time.
meanwhile, this was a huge moment for kieran mckenna and his gutsy side, who won a premier league game for the first time since april 2002.
it means there are no winless teams remaining in the league after both wolves and mckenna's side won this weekend.
that's [inconsistency] down to me.
that's my responsibility.
we didn't start the game well at all.
it was all sort of passive, without the ball, with the ball.
it's a massive, significant moment.
a day to cherish in the recent history.
the journey the club has been on - the highs and the depths.
where the club was two years ago to now competing in the premier league a significant landmark.
just under two years ago ipswich town and kieran mckenna were held to a 1-1 draw with cheltenham town in league one.
what has transpired since has been incredible.
here they were, just two years later, beating tottenham 2-1 in the premier league in their own backyard.
it's another landmark day for ipswich town as a football club, who in a strange quirk of fact beat spurs 2-1 on their last visit to north london, back in 2001 when alun armstrong scored a late winner.
a first premier league win and one they'll remember for a long time.
they are so easy to score against.
set-pieces to start with.
cameron burgess hit the crossbar before ipswich even took their lead via a header from a corner.
he scored one and played a massive part in delap's goal.
yes, tottenham are great to watch.
the city groundattendance:attendance30,145.
newcastle inflicted only a second premier league defeat on nottingham forest this season as a barnstorming second-half comeback earned them a 3-1 victory at the city ground.
forest were aiming for a fourth straight top-flight win for the first time since 1995 - and they led at half-time.
murillo scored his first goal in senior football to give the hosts the lead as the centre-back lost alexander isak at anthony elanga's free-kick to nod past nick pope (21).
isak atoned for his role in forest's opener as he reacted quickest to a loose ball from a corner to stroke in the equaliser (54), before a superb finish from joelinton, curling his left-foot shot in off the post, completed the turnaround (72).
anthony gordon was forced off with an injury, but his replacement harvey barnes scored within three minutes of coming on, reversing a shot between the legs of nikola milenkovic to beat matz sels at his near post (83).
the result means newcastle rise to eighth in the table, while forest remain in third ahead of the second instalment of super sunday between chelsea and arsenal.
after five games without a win, it is now three wins on the bounce for newcastle, who have shown their resilience under eddie howe this term.
they have won two of five premier league away games in which they have conceded first this season, as many as they won after falling 1-0 behind on the road in the competition in 2022-23 and 2023-24 combined.
the day started well for the hosts as they went ahead through murillo.
the central defender, who will head away on international duty with brazil after receiving his first call-up, got in front of his marker from elanga's free-kick to glance past a helpless pope.
newcastle's response was good and they pushed for an immediate leveller, with bruno guimaraes forcing sels into a stretching save.
the belgium goalkeeper was again called into action to keep out dan burn's bundled effort at the far post.
newcastle started the second half on top again and guimaraes came close with an audacious effort with the outside of his boot which went just over.
and moments later, newcastle were finally level.
gordon's corner fell kindly to isak who pounced to convert from close range.
the game opened up and, as forest countered again, burn was lucky not to earn a second yellow card when he chopped down jota silva.
isak blazed a volley just wide before newcastle did go ahead from a counter attack of their own.
isak fed joelinton and the brazilian was given too much space to curl into the far corner from the edge of the area.
they killed the game in the 83rd minute with another goal from back to front as barnes converted at the near post.
let's go again, just proud from day one of how we were working as a team.
they have quality and were lethal in their chances.
we needed some momentum.
we always say how quickly football can change and your fortunes can turn.
so players will go away, we go to saudi arabia, we come back but we try and keep the feeling that we have now.
we know that we're in a good position and we're building our season but we have some key games to come.
forest were chasing the game and it was a lovely piece of play for barnes' goal.
we see it so often with players cutting inside.
the defender opens his body up and just gets it through his legs in that near post.
good strike.
he's a good player.
i'm a big fan of his.
he can't stop.
cuts inside him easily and then swings that left foot and what a finish.
anfield.
liverpool beat aston villa 2-0 at anfield to capitalise on manchester city's defeat at brighton and move five points clear at the top of the premier league table.
villa are eighth after a fourth loss in a row in all competitions for the first time under unai emery.
villa's confidence has taken a hit of late but they did make a promising start at anfield, jacob ramsey having a shot blocked before leon bailey headed over.
ollie watkins wanted a penalty when seemingly nudged over by ibrahima konate inside the box.
but liverpool punished emery's side on the counter-attack, virgil van dijk of all people running free following a villa corner before sending salah clear.
the egyptian tussled with bailey, but the ball reached nunez all the same, finishing high into the net.
those fast breaks remain a fearsome feature of the reds' play.
the force is with them right now.
anfield is abuzz again.
speaking in the press conference after the game, slot discussed the injury to alexander-arnold that saw the player withdrawn in the first half.
but we have to wait and see.
the incident was checked by var but the on-field decision of the referee was not overturned.
because in this situation the decision was clear.
and of course, it was a very important moment in the game.
i accept the decision but i do not agree.
amex stadiumattendance:attendance31,715.
city came into the game on the back of three successive defeats to bournemouth, tottenham and sporting - but their woes looked to be easing as the champions led with 12 minutes to go through erling haaland's first-half strike.
after dominating the early stages and taking the lead when haaland burst through and poked past bart verbruggen at the second attempt, city stepped off the gas following the 30th minute, which allowed brighton back into the game.
the seagulls missed six big chances in the second period - amassing to 1.43 of expected goals - as guardiola's side got lucky while on the ropes.
ederson was forced into a good save from jack hinshelwood's header, while he also snuffed a one-on-one chance for kaoru mitoma.
georginio rutter headed over a good chance, while his replacement pedro dragged wide after being played through over the top.
but brighton's pressure eventually told as danny welbeck trapped a cross from the left, causing a goalmouth scramble.
pedro showed more initiative than the city defenders to slam home from close range.
the brighton goalscorer then turned provider five minutes later as he laid on the ball for the onrushing o'riley, who blasted home while one-on-one.
guardiola could only rock back in his chair as the result moved away from city.
the champions had brought on kevin de bruyne before brighton's two goals and the belgian, clearly not match fit, curled just wide of the post late on.
his fellow substitute bernardo silva dragged another effort wide of the far post, while josko gvardiol headed wide late on as brighton held on during nine minutes of stoppage time.
city, meanwhile, dropped more points in the title race and post-match frustration from guardiola and haaland said it all...
who is going to make this team calm?
there was no one to do it.
but full credit to brighton.
we couldn't finish it, but it's never finished in the premier league.
in the end they scored the goals.
we are not able to continue for a long time in certain moments.
it [losing four games in a row] always happens once in your lifetime right?
we lost two premier league games, that is the point.
hopefully the players come back.
normally some people lose games.
always there's the first time in your life.
this is my challenge, our challenge.
i want to face it.
we want to analyse the fact how we perform.
there are many positives things in the game we lost.
i'm happy for joao and matt with this impact.
they worked hard in the rehab.
unfortunately a win against man city only gives three points.
we have played liverpool and man city, there were four halves but we only played two halves.
gtech community stadium.
brentford twice came from behind to stay unbeaten at home in the premier league in a pulsating 3-2 win over bournemouth at the gtech community stadium.
bournemouth had been on an impressive run, beating title challengers manchester city and arsenal in their last three games, but came unstuck in west london despite leading through evanilson's opener and then justin kluivert from a set-piece routine.
yoane wissa scored twice against bournemouth, his second proving to be the winner and the third goal in a frantic 10-minute period in the second half that saw brentford equalise just 21 seconds after the restart following kluivert making it 2-1.
bournemouth scored the opener after sepp van den berg's poor backpass was pounced on by evanilson, the club-record signing rounding goalkeeper mark flekken to score a career-best third goal in three games after netting against city and aston villa.
his second, in the second half, was a lovely, chipped finish.
thomas franks' side, who move one place above bournemouth into 10th, had to cling on to maintain their unbeaten home record, with substitute dean huijsen striking the bar late on, as they bounced back from defeat at fulham on monday.
in the second half, we had less rhythm.
the game become more stop-start, there were more set-plays.
more or less, the game was what we expected.
the bounce-back mentality was unbelievably good.
we gave them clearly the first goal and then one or two other chances.
the rest of the half was very even.
it was well laid on the short corner from them and then they had that lofted cross in the end.
asked about conceding seven goals in their last three league games, frank said: i am a positive guy.
so i am more focusing on the positive.
that is incredible.
we are brentford.
the bournemouth boss will have plenty of time over the international break to consider how he handles this situation moving forward.
but there is a decision to make with travers, now 25, likely to be seeking more game-time and kepa's future beyond this season unclear.
brentford made headlines earlier in the season for scoring in the first two minutes for four premier league games running.
they repeated their party trick, mid-game admittedly, against bournemouth, equalising to make it 2-2 just 21 seconds after the restart.
no sooner had bournemouth taken the lead through a wonderfully-worked set-piece goal finished off by kluivert than they were picking the ball out of their own net.
we know.
everyone knows.
they score a lot of goals after kick-offs.
they go back and then go long on the left.
bournemouth, on this occasion, were not.
others have tried and failed to stop brentford, the premier league's restart kings.
man city, tottenham, west ham and wolves fell victim to this earlier in the season.
likely others will follow, too.
● this is the first time bournemouth have lost a premier league game in which they have led twice, while it's now three defeats in their last four league matches on the road (d1).
● brentford have scored eight goals from throw-ins in the premier league since their first season in the competition in 2021-22, more than twice as many as any other side.
● there was just 80 seconds between justin kluivert's goal to put bournemouth 2-1 up (48:16) and mikkel damsgaard's equaliser for brentford (49:36).

the wolves boss and his players paraded around the molineux pitch in celebration after the game following a tough week where gary o'neil had been berated with questions regarding his future at the club.
a lot was made about me and my future, but i am comfortable with my position and the future my coaching career has.
today is about wolves, o\'neil said in his post-match press conference.
i did not want to make today about me.
i am pleased for the fans as they have stuck with us.
the visitors thought they found their equaliser through ryan manning, after he lashed the ball into the top corner, but the goal was chalked off following a var review due to a foul on nelson semedo.
the saints continued to build-up patiently from the back but 72 per cent possession in the first half translated to just 0.4xg in front of goal.
after sitting back in the first half, wolves came out after the restart with more tenacity in the final third and quickly doubled their lead through cunha.
the brazil forward, who set up the first goal with an impressive run on the counter-attack, curled his effort into the far corner and sent the home crowd into raptures.
angst, anger and anticipation turned to joy and adulation from the home crowd for this group of players, as they secured their first win of the season and leapfrogged their opponents into 18th.
the players deserve it.
they have put in the work.
second half we were excellent without the ball and did not feel under any real threat.
we were solid.
took a bit of moving around as their shape caused us some issues.
we spoke about being humble enough about defending low.
to come here and have as much as we did, is not easy.
we were made to pay for individual errors.
i liked the response.
we played really good football until we got there.
there has to be more.
we can't just turn up and fight.
the team is not built for that.
it builds up to get to the final third so they can do their stuff.
it just did not come to enough.
o'neil's team saw less of the ball - only 28 per cent of it to be exact - but limited southampton to just one shot on target in this fixture.
they were organised and disciplined throughout, which will be welcomed by management, players and the fanbase.
staying on the topic of goals - but for all the wrong reasons in southampton's case.
martin's side had 72 per cent of the ball at molineux - but this translated to just 0.60xg in front of goal.

no-one expected perfect free-flowing football on the table after 10 games, but they expected some sign of a direction of travel.
but after years of relative stability, with the caveat of defensive football, under moyes, the chaotic underbelly at the london stadium has returned.
something has to change, and fast.
in his first game against aston villa it was still tomas soucek, the robust 6ft 4ins remnant of the moyes era, making late runs into the box to latch onto long balls in behind.
west ham are playing fewer passes in the opposition half than at any stage under moyes.
the percentage of long passes is stubbornly refusing to drop.
michail antonio continues to work hard up front, but at 34 his best years are firmly behind him.
the £27m arrival has managed just three substitute appearances in the premier league, and has not featured since august.
kudus is the only one of 10 major signings under his remit whose introduction has been a clear success, though last summer's six newcomers still need time to bed in.
but the starting midfield at nottm forest of edson alvarez and guido rodriguez, were both clear steidten signings.
extrapolating from the first 10 games, both of the seasons since his departure are on course for being west ham's worst defensively since the formation of the premier league.
he is yet to find a solution but tried to paper over it at forest last weekend when he switched to a 3-4-3 for the first time.
the debacle at tottenham three weeks ago summed it up.
lopetegui stressed the importance of belief and consistency in his pre-match press conference on thursday.
we have to create a kind of strength inside the team, he said.
confidence is a commodity hard-earned and easily lost in football.
a move to city, where pep guardiola is out of contract next summer, had been long mooted for amorim before he put pen to paper last week on a contract to become man utd's new head coach from november 11.
it was confirmed last month that viana, who appointed amorim at sporting in 2020, will become man city's new director of football at the end of the season.
speaking ahead of sporting's champions league game with city on tuesday, amorim revealed the prospect of following his friend to the etihad had crossed his mind.
obviously, it's something which crossed my mind but i never had any doubt, he said.
my decision has been made, that's the club i want to work for, the context i want to be in, and where i want to continue my career.
i didn't want anything else.
it is a decision i thought about but was not undecided about it.
i wanted man utd and that's what i did.
i don't think about it, he said.
my focus is about winning the match, and winning it for sporting.
then, the conclusions people will draw are not important for me.
they could be erroneous.
that's not exactly a poor starting point to start at man utd.
so i'm not interested what conclusions what people draw.
i'm interested in winning the match, having a good farewell and then after that starting a new life in man utd.
i don't know what is better for me when i start my new adventure in manchester.
what i want is to leave the sporting fans and my players happy, and to qualify for the play-offs.
ruben is one of the reasons i came to sporting, he said.
then he knows his role, what he can bring to the team and to ruben.
i can't tell you all the details, but man utd are in good hands with ruben.
arsenal are prepared to wait for the right person as a long-term replacement for edu rather than rushing to make an appointment.
the overriding feeling towards edu's decision has been one of gratitude and well wishes for the work that the brazilian has done.
during the international break, the football leadership team will meet with owners the kroenke family to discuss strategy and squad-building ahead of the next windows.
the gathering is a tradition, and edu's successor will be on the agenda.
the gunners' difficult run of form has coincided with the absence of key players, most notably captain martin odegaard through injury, and a string of red-card suspensions for leandro trossard, declan rice and william saliba.
it could be very dangerous towards march, april, may.
we're not interested.
come on.
you can win the league title.
this is where you become a hero.
it's where you become arsenal legends.
no one's interested in whether you've got a few injuries for a part of the season.
those players will come back.
don't wait for them.
that's when you really want to be flying.
arsenal have already won at aston villa and tottenham while taking a point from their trip to manchester city despite being a player down for the entire second half.
it's a massive game.
they're not in the worst position.
guardiola's side were beaten at bournemouth on saturday, ending a 30-game unbeaten league run and allowing liverpool to take a two-point lead at the top of the table.
the defeat is city's worst since a 5-2 thrashing by leicester four years ago.
it is only the third time a pep guardiola team has shipped four goals in a champions league game.
bernardo silva said afterwards that city are in a dark place - but what are the issues they face, with a tricky looking game against brighton - live on sky sports - on the horizon?
are fans right to be worried?
and what do the stats say about their performances?
we know we will struggle and we have to accept that, and it is fine, he said.
the games will be difficult; in previous seasons it was smooth.
personal reasons, injuries, we won six premier leagues in seven years.
things change, we have to accept that.
jack grealish is also still out and add in the long-term injuries to ballon d'or winner rodri and oscar bobb, and man city's resources are heavily depleted.
manuel akanji was fit enough to start against sporting but has had injury niggles of his own, while nathan ake was an unused substitute.
rico lewis deputised again for kyle walker, who was only fit enough to be named on the bench.
a positive was the sight of kevin de bruyne back on the pitch but the belgium international was only called upon for the final six minutes of the heavy defeat, while jeremy doku also got minutes from the bench.
it happened in my first year, he said.
sometimes it does.
sport is that.
life is that.
sometimes we have bad moments but we face the reality.
we are still alive in all competitions and we continue.
the norway forward cut a frustrated figure after seeing his second-half penalty crash against the crossbar in lisbon.
city's squad currently offers little support in this area, which is highlighted by defender josko gvardiol currently being tied for second for goals across all competitions, with three.
there was a familiar feel to sporting's first two goals on tuesday night, with gyokeres and maximiliano araujo the latest players to get in behind man city's defence and profit from their growing vulnerability from quick and direct attacks.
those goals were not the only examples in the game, with gyokeres missing an earlier one-on-one having been put through on goal from inside his own half following a transition.
the penalty for sporting's third came after francisco trincao had got in behind in similar fashion.
amazingly, city have allowed 10 more shots from fast breaks than any other premier league side in all competitions.
they are giving up chances from fast breaks at a rate roughly three-times higher than last season.
the same underlying metrics show no great drop-off domestically either.
city won the premier league title last season with the second-highest expected goal difference in the division and sit in the same place now, albeit just behind liverpool rather than arsenal.
i won't give up, that's for sure, guardiola said after the loss to sporting.
this is new territory for him and his city side, who have grown accustomed to dominating english football since his arrival in 2016.
the off-field issues surrounding the club are well documented with the exit of sporting director txiki begiristain and the alleged breaches of financial rules looming over them.
but up until now, his team had not faltered.
is the pressure of the outside noise finally seeping into the dressing room?
i don't agree with him.
we are not in the dark side, he continued.
we played really bad against bournemouth but really good here.
we knew it would be a tough season at the start and this is what it is.
i like it, i love it, i want to face it and lift my players.
life is like this.
we continue.
what should we do?
we go back to manchester and prepare for the game at brighton.
grealish, stones and dias are all rumoured to be returning after the break, when city host tottenham at the etihad stadium on november 23, live on sky sports.
throw in a champions league game against feyenoord before a mouthwatering clash with league leaders liverpool at anfield on sunday december 1, against live on sky sports, and a midweek fixture against high-flying nottingham forest on december 4.
this is no easy run.
i remember when i met my first agent, he recalls, thinking back to his time as a teenage academy prospect at sc braga, in portugal.
he asked me what i wanted to be.
i just said, 'i want to be the best'.
neto was brought up in a competitive sporting environment.
his father was a professional roller hockey player, his mother played volleyball, his older twin sisters were national trampolining champions and his uncle was a professional footballer.
neto could have followed in his father's footsteps but football won out when he joined braga's academy at the age of 13.
i always idolise my father because i used to play hockey like him, neto continues.
the mentality i have comes from me, but of course also my education with him.
when i was younger i used to see my father playing, and the attitude he had on the field i took myself when i started playing football at a young age.
it was not easy to be away from home with braga at such a young age.
the young neto would return from training at around 9pm each evening to his home in viana do castelo, a small coastal town in the far north of portugal, just in time to have a meal with his family before getting some sleep.
it was really good to grow, to get into a different environment, to understand more about life, he explains.
even today i still get messages from them.
after four years, neto moved to lazio, on loan with another braga academy player, midfielder bruno jordao.
i was young and innocent, i had no idea about the types of personality some people could have.
i grew up a lot, there.
wolves was different, though.
with six portuguese players already in the first-team squad working under head coach nuno espirito santo, it turned out to be a home from home.
of course it helped a lot.
it was really important for me, the first season i had here.
i learned and developed a lot with nuno and his coaching staff.
neto made huge strides during his first two seasons at molineux, with his raw pace and trademark dribbling attracting wider attention.
he attributes his running style to his childhood playing hockey and the low centre of gravity needed to weave past opponents.
but after appearing in the first 31 of wolves' premier league fixtures during the behind-closed-doors 202021 season, a serious knee injury in april ruled him out for 10 months.
he has not managed to play a full campaign since.
when i arrived at chelsea i was really thankful, but i had been injured, he admits.
i played in the european championship without a lot of games before that.
at the moment, i feel really good.
any supporters' fears of over lingering hamstring problems were eased with the opening goal of the 2-1 victory over newcastle united last month.
running from deep inside his own half, neto sped past tino livramento to collect a pinpoint pass from cole palmer.
fabian schar's attempted challenge was hurdled and, one pass later, nicolas jackson had the ball in the net.
at 24 years old, neto fits the profile of a squad that has the potential to grow stronger together over many seasons.
no, i don't think so.
we go into all the games with the mentality to win.
we are judged in every match we play.
neto's personal quest to find consistency, be the best he can be, reveals itself away from the football pitch.
she will say to me, 'you just live for football.
when i am with [former wolves team-mates] ruben and diogo jota when we are away with the national team, it is the same, we are always speaking about football.
neto is happy to carry the tag of a football obsessive with a winning mentality, though.
he has been playing very well all the season, said bournemouth boss andoni iraola of semenyo afterwards.
it is almost three years since a player - adama traore, predictably - completed six dribbles in a premier league game against city.
the decision was not made to target walker.
semenyo actually ranks third in the premier league for possessions won in the attacking third of the pitch.
as for shots taken, only erling haaland has more of them than the ghanaian so far this season.
while a third of those shots have been from outside the box, the only wide forward with a higher expected-goals total than semenyo this season is mohamed salah.
of course, salah himself remains the master.
he curled in a beautiful goal of his own towin the game for liverpool against brightonat anfield.
now 32, salah retains that rare and remarkable ability to find time and space in the opposition penalty area.
salah is a fine finisher when in form and is outperforming his expected-goals total this season.
salah's last 130 premier league goals have been scored from an expected-goals figure of 129.86.
since signing for liverpool in the summer of 2017, salah has had 2261 touches of the ball in the opposition penalty box, which is almost twice as many as any other player except raheem sterling - and it is over 600 more touches than him.
it is astonishing.
chelsea's draw at manchester unitedwas a scrappy affair short on quality, although moises caicedo did come out of it with the player of the match award and his reputation enhanced.
it was his volley low into the corner of the net that earned chelsea a point.
one year on and we are starting to see the talent that sparked the transfer.
players are human beings, said chelsea boss enzo maresca.
it is normal to have little ups and downs.
since we arrived, moi is improving a lot.
we are trying to spend time with him, and all the rest also, to try and improve them.
moi is showing how good he is.
most of the time in football, one plus one is not two.
he needs a little bit more time to adapt.
caicedo, who turned 23 on saturday, now leads the premier league for tackles made this season.
he also ranks in the top 10 for interceptions, possession won in the middle third of the pitch and possession won in the final third of the pitch for that matter.
with confidence, his work on the ball is becoming tidier.
early in his chelsea career, he was targeted in the build-up.
now, maresca is trusting him in that role, collecting the ball from defenders.
belatedly, he is becoming the player they thought they had signed.
gw1: salah's sprints, saka's one-on-ones, mount's pressinggw2: calvert-lewin's runs, odegaard's pressing, pereira's cornersgw3: de bruyne's position, gravenberch's runs, dawson's returngw4: nuno's masterclass, duran's strike rate, nketiah's shootinggw5: diaz's finishing, traore's end product, archer's issuesgw6: mcneil's role, kulusevski's creativity, gravenberch's carryinggw7: saka's creativity, kovacic's shooting, mitoma's return to formgw8: rashford's form, buonanotte's tackling, gvardiol's passinggw9: palmer's positioning, iwobi's passing, savinho's box entries
after 473 minutes without a goal, a barren run dating back to the end of september, dominic solanke only needed four minutes to turn one into two.
his first was beautifully-taken as he latched onto dejan kulusevski's pass to lift a delicate finish over emiliano martinez.
for his second, he was in the right place at the right time following a turnover to meet richarlison's low cross with a powerful strike from close range.
each of them missed the target in the final minute of regulation time from inside the box.
those two have been guilty of spurning chances throughout the campaign.
he has so often been devoid of service at old trafford.
their nine goals scored is the second worst, behind only southampton, who are 19th in the table after claiming their first win this weekend.
no wonder this is their worst start to a premier league season.
palmer has now been fouled 23 times in his last seven starts for chelsea, which is a huge spike on his numbers from last season.
he is a marked man.
aston villa's loss at tottenham was unai emery's first taste of defeat in the premier league since mid-september.
since the villans lost to arsenal in the third game of the season they have since gone seven games without defeat.
the spurs defeat means of the three meetings with the traditional big six this season villa are yet to win, their only point coming against manchester united.
villa have also only scored one goal in those fixtures.
emery's side have also one win in four games against teams that finished in last season's top 10.
we have been consistent until today, emery told press.
but we will need more.
but it failed miserably.
moments after duran replaced morgan rogers, who had been taken off as a precaution after picking up a knock, dominic solanke netted a quick-fire double to give the hosts a two-goal lead before james maddison made it 4-1 with a free-kick in stoppage-time.
of the five goals scored in these games, duran is responsible for two, including his stunner against everton, and watkins has one to his name.
watkins and duran occupy similar spaces when on the field and are yet to build the chemistry needed to operate simultaneously.
in the small sample size of minutes duran has seen on his own in the premier league, villa concede three goals per game in comparison to just one with watkins flying solo.
watkins and rogers form a formidable partnership with their pressing and the latter ranks in the top 15 players for successful turnovers (34) as a result of this work-rate.
it is the process we have and we are building a team.
we are trying to get a strong structure in everything.
a situation we have to work with is those two strikers.
every match is a challenge in the premier league, champions league and the cups.
we are analysing performances and then trying to get the best decisions.
this is not the first time watkins has struggled to gel with another striker at the club.
whether or not this will materialise in the same villa team remains to be seen.
united's new-manager bounce fell flat in a stale1-1 draw with chelseaat old trafford that confirmed their worst start to a premier league season.
ruud van nistelrooy, united's interim boss until amorim arrives on november 11, was unable to help spark the team into form as they played out a dismal draw with the west londoners.
there is a long way back for this team.
this is an average manchester united team.
all the stats back that up.
they are hit and miss - you never know which team will turn up.
not good.
it's really disappointing.
it's so flat.
this team is way off it, getting back in the top four.
united are average at everything.
there is nothing special about them.
it was very quiet at old trafford.
i was glad when the referee blew the final whistle.
manchester united captain bruno fernandes revealed that he has apologised to former boss erik ten hag after his sacking last week.
i spoke to the manager [ten hag] and apologised to him, i was disappointed he has gone and i tried to help him.
but keane had little sympathy for fernandes and criticised his leadership.
it will be interesting to hear what ten hag says about it.
the proof is there with all the results.
the players have let the manager down.
vitality stadiumattendance:attendance11,231.
man city suffered their first premier league defeat of 2024 as they were beaten 2-1 by bournemouth after turning in a performance well below par at the vitality stadium.
antoine semenyo and evanilson struck to seal a deserved victory for the cherries who had never before beaten city in the league in their entire history.
bournemouth smelled blood from the off.
inside two minutes, ederson was forced into a double save to first deny semenyo and then justin kluivert from the follow-up and, after the lively start continued, the laser-focused semenyo turned and tucked home his fourth of the season after being picked out by milos kerkez.
man city lacked any sort of fluency going forward and ended the first half, uncharacteristically, without a shot on target.
kerkez bravely blocked a drive from bernardo silva and erling haaland skewed wide, but that was as good as it got.
a last-ditch save from ederson prevented evanilson from doubling the hosts' lead shortly after the start of the second half, but the brazilian did just that after 64 minutes, making early contact with a wicked kerkez ball to catch the city stopper out.
amazingly, it could have been three when the cherries broke again within minutes, but marcus tavernier struck the post before adam smith somehow blazed the rebound over with the goal gaping.
josko gvardiol got on the end of an ilkay gundogan cross to loop in a header and halve the deficit, which set up an incredibly tense finale.
but city knew their luck was out when haaland guided a simple shot onto the post from point-blank range at the death.
it feels great.
you have to enjoy this today; tomorrow we will start to think about brentford.
apart from the result, i'm very proud of the performance.
i've lost so many times against him [guardiola], so you have to enjoy when the day arrives!
it is the first premier league game they lost in 2024 and we are in november.
there was less recovery from the trip from london.
they had chances, we created some especially at the end.
the guys gave everything.
kyle walker has trained 16 days and not done a single session.
he made an incredible effort.
yesterday was the first time we trained as a team.
manuel akanji couldn't play in the last game because of a niggle.
nathan ake is in the wars and made an incredible effort.
guardiola claimed his side had only 13 first-team players available to face bournemouth after their 2-1 loss at tottenham in the carabao cup in midweek.
st james' park, newcastleattendance:attendance52,249.
arsenal slipped further off the pace at the top of the premier league table after alexander isak's brilliant early header handed them a 1-0 defeat at newcastle.
after losing on the road in the league for the first time in 2024at bournemouthlast time out, the gunners slumped again at st james' park and could find themselveseight points behind leaders manchester cityby the end of the weekend.
mikel merino's shot was blocked on the line by lewis hall and declan rice's deflected effort trickled just wide, but arsenal rarely tested nick pope.
raya was required to prevent newcastle extending their lead, making saves from joe willock and isak, before another hall block kept out leandro trossard's volley.
stand-in skipper bukayo saka finally carved out a chance in the dying moments when his cross found rice at the far post, but the midfielder's header slipped wide - and arsenal's chances of taking a point back to north london faded away.
you are relying on two or three big chances - the one with mikel [merino], two for declan [rice], one with gabriel jesus.
that's the frustrating part.
but credit to newcastle as well for what they do.
we're not going to find the right answers or words now to describe how we feel.
we have to put it on the field on wednesday night against inter.
it's not about the hope of winning the title.
it's about being our best version of each other every single week.
i would have felt that at the beginning of the game.
i didn't have that feeling.
we don't have [odegaard].
we can discuss that all day long.
we haven't had him for the last four or five, six weeks.
and we don't have him yet.
but we have many other answers that are effective.
we have to look at ourselves, congratulate newcastle and then move on.
instead, this was a toothless display on the road.
one shot on target, none from open play and newcastle goalkeeper nick pope was not required to make a save all game.
arsenal's attack went completely missing.
but the vast majority of the total came from mikel merino's blocked shot and declan rice's late miss.
even after missing the last six weeks of the season, the arsenal captain has more chances created from open play than any top-flight player.
he may return in midweek for inter milan but has his return already come too late?
everyone played a big part in that win today.
it's been a good few days for us, it goes to show how football can change quite quicky.
two good performances against two good teams.
today was about heart, determination, desire and quality as well.
two good days for us.
we know it's been inconsistency.
in the last few games our performance level has increased.
twice in the second half, newcastle players celebrated successful defensive actions as if they had scored a goal.
bruno guimaraes winning a throw-in - cue exuberant fist pumps.
joelinton outmuscling gabriel at the far post - bring on the roar in front of thousands of baying home fans.
but this all changed against arsenal, who have now suffered defeat - and failed to score - on three of their last four visits to st james' park.
ruben amorim revealed he asked to delay his manchester united start time until the end of the season but was told it was now or never – as he passionately defended his exit to sporting fans.
amorim was confirmed as united boss on friday and will take sporting's games against manchester city and braga next week before taking over at old trafford on november 11.
the 39-year-old revealed he spent three days deciding his options - and changed his mind several times in the process - before eventually agreeing to move to man utd mid-season.
speaking after sporting's win over estrela, amorim said: at the beginning of the season, i had a talk with [president frederico varandas] and hugo viana [then-sporting director] and i said that whatever happened, this would be my last season with sporting.
the president is here, he can confirm that.
the season started, we know that we started very well.
then the manchester united situation came and they appeared.
they paid above the release clause.
i never discussed anything with the president about this bargaining.
the only question i made was only to go at the end of the season.
for three days, i said i wanted to stay until the end of the season.
i had three days to make my decision.
the change is radical in my life but i had three days to make this decision.
that's what i did.
i have had other opportunities, the president and viana can confirm this is not the first or the second time i was asked for by another team.
i wanted that one in manchester.
i want that context.
that context allows me to do things my way.
it's just like sporting.
amorim continued in a lengthy, impassioned first answer press conference: i mean, let's not go around the bush.
gyokeres costs £100m, said amorim.
it's very complicated.
i will not take any of sporting's players in january.
but that's another story.
there was no revolt whatsoever [from the sporting players about amorim's exit].
but they were sad.
the players were anxious.
we could feel the atmosphere was a little different.
i have been with them for five years, they have been with me for five years.
i even talked to them before i signed them.
it's part of our characteristics to be close to the players.
they know i'm the coach until braga [final game], then i'm leaving.
but disappointment?
yes.
the sporting fans felt a little better about life as they left the jose alvalade stadium.
they had braved the deluge of rain before kick-off to voice their frustrations of feeling betrayed - not so much about amorim's exit but the timing of it.
come full-time, amorim disappeared down the tunnel pretty quickly.
he has one final home game - the champions league encounter against manchester city - to say his goodbyes.
a finale that brings a glimpse of what's to come and how amorim might take on the challenge of life as a premier league head coach.
a former benfica and portugal midfielder, amorim retired as a player in 2017 and two years later took up his first managerial job at braga.
the portuguese then joined sporting in march 2020, establishing himself as one of europe's most sought-after young coaches, twice guiding the club to the primeira liga title.
amorim has also won the taca da liga - the portuguese league cup - on three occasions, twice with sporting and once with braga.
another great deal by the board, €10m for unlicensed manager, one sarcastic comment read.
interestingly, although ten hag mentions the warmth he received from everyone at the club there is no mention of the man utd players, staff or hierarchy...
in a statement released via his agency, ten hag said: dear fans, let me start by thanking you.
thank you for always being there for the club.
whether it was a game far away or a tough match at old trafford, your support has been unshakeable.
the atmosphere at old trafford has always been electrifying thanks to you.
i felt it many times.
i always enjoyed meeting manchester united fans throughout the world.
walking the streets and being able to chat with fans in england, europe, asia, australia, the usa - you inspired me and radiated a strong sense of unity.
i want to thank you for giving me this feeling and for your support.
i also want to thank the staff in every department of the club for their unwavering support in good times and bad.
we won two trophies - achievements that i will cherish for the rest of my life.
of course, my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet.
unfortunately, that dream has come to an end.
i wish all manchester united fans nothing but success, trophies and glory.
your support and the warmth i received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home.
thank you for this chapter in my life.
erik.

southampton earned their first premier league victory of the season with a 1-0 win over everton, who hit the woodwork twice and had a late equaliser ruled out.
adam armstrong struck in the 85th minute to move the saints off the bottom just seconds after everton substitute beto had headed against the crossbar from inside the six-yard box.
a drab first half gave way to an improved second with southampton goalkeeper aaron ramsdale pushing orel mangala's shot over the crossbar.
however, his best save came in the 67th minute when he superbly tipped michael keane's goal-bound header onto the right post.
the hosts rode their luck as jan bednarek escaped with only a yellow card following a var check for bringing down beto as he tried to burst through.
jack harrison then poked wide before beto improbably missed from close range, leading to southampton breaking up the other end and taking the lead through armstrong's clinical finish.
sean dyche's side then thought they had equalised in the 89th minute when beto brilliantly controlled a long ball forward and slotted past ramsdale, but var came to southampton's rescue by ruling the goal out for offside and ending everton's five-game unbeaten run.
the big calls didn't go for us either, particularly the one where beto goes straight through.
how that's not a sending-off, i don't know.
he's inside the v as the referees work on.
they get a breakaway, sometimes that happens from a misshapen team.
it's huge for us as a team, as a group, as a club, and the clean sheet as well.
we played some beautiful football, some brilliant football and had to dig in at times.
rambo (aaron ramsdale) made a couple of brilliant saves.
i'm really proud of them for that.
it's a really good goal.

chris wood continued his fine form in front of goal after netting the opener against west ham united during a 3-0 win which took nottingham forest into third for the first time since 1998.
the forest forward headed home with the first shot on target for either side on the afternoon after latching onto alex moreno's cross from the left (27).
after coming close to equalising through lucas paqueta and his effort that was cleared off the line, west ham's misery in the first half was compounded by a red card for edson alvarez.
the midfielder picked up two bookings in the space of three minutes to reduce his side to 10 players after leaving referee peter bankes with no choice by lunging in on anthony elanga.
callum hudson-odoi had been heavily involved throughout the fixture and eventually got his name on the scoresheet after curling in a second for the hosts from outside the box (65).
ola aina went on to add a third and arguably the pick of the bunch as he capitalised on an error from jean-clair todibo before lashing an effort into the top left corner to round-off an impressive victory for his high-flying side.
this is what football is about, fantastic moment for us and the fans.
pushed for an answer on his hopes for the season after breaking into the top four, nuno added: you know me.
it is 10 minutes after the game but i am thinking about the next training session.
it doesn't mean anything now.
we have to keep going as it's a ver long season ahead of us.
positive moment but we should keep going.
it is all going right for forest currently.
the sky is the limit for this side.
they have all the necessary components at the ready and continue to churn out performances and results against solid opponents.
it was a tough night for us.
this is my work.
there were moments we could have drawn the match.
we have to look forward for the next challenge.
it was a third formation change of the season from julen lopetegui, as he returned to the 3-4-3 he used during the 3-0 defeat to chelsea.
however, the forest forward nodded in the opener moments later and it was not long before west ham were reduced to 10 and the game spiralled out of their control.
and he was right.
west ham started well but unravelled even before the red card.
at the moment, they seem like a team lacking direction.
ruben amorim has been appointed as the new manchester united head coach and will join on november 11, once he has fulfilled his obligations with sporting.
united have paid sporting an extra €1m (£840,000) on top of his €10m (£8.4m) exit clause for an early release from his 30-day notice period.
he replaces erik ten hag who was sacked last month while ruud van nistelrooy will continue to take charge of the first team until amorim joins.
amorim is the first united boss to have the title of head coach rather than manager.
a former benfica and portugal midfielder, amorim retired as a player in 2017 and two years later took up his first managerial job at braga.
the portuguese then joined sporting in march 2020, establishing himself as one of europe's most sought-after young coaches, twice guiding the club to the primeira liga title.
amorim has also won the taca da liga - the portuguese league cup - on three occasions, twice with sporting and once with braga.
another great deal by the board, €10m for unlicensed manager, one sarcastic comment read.
winning the title with sporting in 2021 at the age of 36 all but guaranteed that.
sporting recognised that this was a special talent very early, famously paying a huge release clause after his spectacular start at braga.
most managers are head coaches now.
the kind of people who are buying clubs like to have a modern structure in place, directors of football, sporting directors, recruitment directors.
he may prove to be the final piece of the jigsaw when it comes to ineos' rebuilding of the club.
we've seen a new ceo, new sporting director, new technical director.
amorim is their man.
he's their first head coach hire.
ruud van nistelrooy has said he's happy to remain in interim charge for as long as is needed by the club.
he was told it was short term, and that the club had a candidate they wanted to secure quickly.
he wants to remain at old trafford and help rebuild the club.
he did admit, though, there will need be a conversation when amorim is in post.
we know that amorim wants to bring his own staff with him, and two are long-serving assistants, so what does that actually mean for van nistelrooy?
will he be kept on?
or will united have to pay compensation to release him from his contract?
well, ruben amorim is a man who likes to have that power.
when he sets his sights on a player, he wants him.
he likes to have an influence and he likes to have the power.
he's of course portuguese, even if they haven't worked together distantly.
nearly three-quarters of the current manchester united squad comprises players signed by erik ten hag.
amorim inherits a side with 19 of the 27-player squad either signed or promoted into the first team by the dutchman.
ten hag splashed £616.8m on signings during his time at old trafford - only chelsea outspent the club during that period.
nearly half of that money was spent on players ten hag had managed previously.

the portuguese coach looks poised to take over at old trafford and become the permanent successor to erik ten hag, who was sacked on monday.
he\'s done amazing at sporting, said merson.
this is going to be different.
no disrespect.
they play against porto and benfica and that's it.
he's coming in to manage one of the biggest clubs in the world.
there's a lot of work to be done.
this is five steps up.
i don't know if he will.
but this is different.
it's hard to explain.
one of the biggest football clubs in the world with a just-above-average football team.
i\'d be surprised if they went top four, said merson.
it's going to take time.
they have to be patient, bring players in steadily.
getting the players to understand the way they want to play, said merson when asked about amorim's first main goal at united.
i watch man utd play and there hasn't been identity there for a long time now.
he has to come in, get his ideas across and start playing as a team.
they don't press together.
he has to get everybody understanding the way he wants to play.
chelsea against newcastle, you know what they're trying to do.
that manager has been in there two or three months.
they've got to learn how to walk first.
i don't know how long it is going to take but it won't happen overnight on a consistent basis.
another key for amorim will be making the right moves in the transfer market, says merson.
ten hag got the transfer market horribly wrong.
they bought antony for £80m... that's a sacking in itself!
they will push their wing backs on to help the two in midfield.
that's where they'll probably have to recruit: pace at the back.
and they need a goalscorer.
the two lads up front haven't done it.

it was a straightforward and routine victory for sporting on the pitch over nacional on tuesday.
will ruben amorim's move to manchester united be as routine?
it's looking that way, although the man himself wasn't giving too much away as i attended his post-match press conference in lisbon.
i was very interested to see him away from the touchline.
he handled tricky questions well.
it was impressive.
he took 15 questions in portuguese, some of it got heated, but he gave those journalists the same answers he gave me which is we'll all have to wait before things become clear.
he said it's his decision as the clubs have agreed a deal if he wants to go.
when i asked him whether or not he'd be in the dugout on sunday at old trafford he said i'll be here and i said are you sure?
he smiled, replying i don't know.
so he was showing a little bit of humour there, giving quite a lot away without saying much.
there was a mixture of him respecting the sporting fans and respecting manchester united.
a smart move.
interestingly he didn't wave to the fans after the game but there will be a full stadium here on friday so potentially a deal could be done with united and he can say those goodbyes then.
does he want to take on the challenge of manchester united?
of course he does.
he's ambitious and there is big money involved.
things could move quite quickly.
and this is a man who looks ready for the spotlight.
winning the title with sporting in 2021 at the age of 36 all but guaranteed that.
sporting recognised that this was a special talent very early, famously paying a huge release clause after his spectacular start at braga.
the holding midfielder has to never, ever be in the highlights.
but the highlights have to belong to other people.
a conversation with bernardo silva in the summer also comes to mind.
the ultimate team man himself, he hinted at his contempt for these individual trinkets.
look at the teams that win titles.
the base comes from a very good defence.
and yet, here we are.
rodri.
ballon d'or winner.
but glory with spain changed everything.
goals still attract our attention.
picture city in possession and you will picture rodri, spraying it left and right, the ball rarely more than a few passes away from returning to its rightful spot at his feet.
he had over 4000 touches of the football in the premier league last season.
it was a record.
it is not.
he holds off his marker, drops a shoulder and strolls away.
there are numbers for everything in football now and some of them help to articulate what the eye can see.
there were 2068 of rodri's passes last season that were played while under pressure, 500 more than the next man on the list.
he works in tight spaces.
and yet, he seldom surrenders the ball.
he ranked among the top five players in the premier league for line-breaking passes.
alongside those playmakers martin odegaard and the risk-taking bruno fernandes, there was rodri, probing away.
and he was working in an extra dimension to everyone else.
rodri can go between or over.
every club in the bag.
for those who prefer their statistics slightly more consequential, there were also eight goals and nine assists in city's premier league title-winning campaign.
only five players in the competition could better him on both counts and all of them were forwards.
rodri brings more, of course.
much more.
internally, all team-mates and staff, they all know how important and decisive he is, said guardiola.
massively important for us.
no doubt.
that is how it seemed for a while.
in the six games that city played against premier league opposition without rodri last season, they lost to everyone except luton.
they were unbeaten in the 49 with him until being denied the double in the fa cup final.
there followed that special summer with spain but this award is bitter-sweet in that it arrives with him injured.
a banner was unveiled at the etihad stadium for the inter game in september that read, 'can we talk about rodri?'
four days later, the leg gave way.
but he is in the spotlight again now.
his manager and his team-mates can only smile as the holding midfielder supposed to operate in the shadows receives the award supposedly reserved for the glory guys.
finally, the football world is talking about rodri.
ruben amorim insisted nothing has yet been decided as man utd and sporting remain in advanced negotiations for the portuguese manager.
sporting confirmed to the portuguese stock exchange on tuesday that united are willing to meet amorim's release clause after making him the number one choice to replace erik ten hag, who was sacked on monday.
key figures from manchester united are in portugal as negotiations continue with lisbon over their pursuit of erik ten hag's successor.
sky sports news understands the focus of the talks remains on the backroom staff amorim may want to bring with him to old trafford.
on wednesday night, ahead of man utd's carabao cup win over leicester city, executive sir dave brailsford was filmed appearing to tell a supporter it's done when asked about the latest on amorim's move to old trafford.
media flocked to portugal for what could be the 39-year-old's last game in charge as sporting beat nacional 3-1 in the portuguese league cup quarter-final to probe amorim on his potential move to old trafford.
this doesn't change.
i have nothing new to say at this moment.
he was quoted as telling broadcast media: nothing is decided yet.
i don't know if it's the farewell game or not.
speaking later at his press conference in portuguese, amorim said: there was the club's statement and that's the only thing they have at the moment.
there is interest from manchester united, there is the payment of a clause and then, when i have something more concrete, i will tell you, because it is always my choice.
i'm not going to say anything properly, because i don't have anything useful to say.
just saying that i will take on whatever i want to do, as i have always done throughout my time as a player and even as a coach.
regarding the game, it was a strange game, a strange environment.
when asked simply, do you want to leave by a journalist, amorim replied: we haven't got to that part.
the club talks to another club, is talking to another club, and then you take the next step with the coach.
and whether i want to go or not, i'll say later.
that's the decision we're talking about here.
i won't say.
amorim was unable to give a definitive timeline over how long that would take.
asked if that was for sure, amorim added: [laughing] i don't know!
before leaving, amorim added: i will explain everything.
it will be very clear.
a former benfica and portugal midfielder, amorim retired as a player in 2017 and just two years later he took up his first managerial job at braga.
he then joined sporting in march 2020 where he has established himself as one of europe's most sought-after young coaches, twice guiding the club to the league title.
he has also won the taca da liga - the portuguese league cup - on three occasions, twice with sporting and once with braga.
he said: without a doubt, without a doubt.
but i don't interfere in the players' lives.
i want to do well for the group.
i talked to the board about how we are going to manage the squad.
but it's part of life.
that happened with me already in braga.
when i came from braga, from braga's stability to here, that happened a little.
but then things happen that change people's lives.
and so, it's a difficult situation.
i can't give you more than that.
i understand that the players are even disappointed, sad.
but i have to live with it.
and that's what i'm going to do.
he took 15 questions in portuguese, some of it got heated, but he gave those journalists the same answers he gave me which is we'll all have to wait before things become clear.
he said it's his decision as the clubs have agreed a deal if he wants to go.
when i asked him whether or not he'd be in the dugout on sunday at old trafford he said 'i'll be here' and i said 'are you sure' and he smiled, replying 'i don't know.'
so he was showing a little bit of humour there, giving quite a lot away.
he enjoys portugal and his job here.
does he want to take on the challenge of manchester united?
of course he does.
he's ambitious and there is big money involved.
things could move quite quickly.
winning the title with sporting in 2021 at the age of 36 all but guaranteed that.
sporting recognised that this was a special talent very early, famously paying a huge release clause after his spectacular start at braga.
manchester united have approached sporting over appointing head coach ruben amorim as their new boss.
talks are thought to be ongoing over making the 39-year-old erik ten hag's successor after the dutchman was sacked on monday morning.
united would need to pay the portuguese's sporting release clause - and it is understood they are prepared to do that.
sporting have a 100 per cent record at the top of the portuguese league this season having won all nine games scoring 30 goals and conceding just twice.
meanwhile, in the champions league, amorim's side are unbeaten having won two of their three games to sit eighth.
when asked about his future in the wake of ten hag's sacking, amorim said at a pre-match press conference on monday: i was expecting that question and obviously i am not going to talk about my future.
he added: i am very proud of being sporting head coach.
in recent weeks he has been suggested as a future manchester city manager with sporting's hugo viana, a close friend, due to move to the blue half of manchester as the club's new director of football next season.
amorim had been in the running to replace jurgen klopp at liverpool in the summer before arne slot was handed the job.
he also held talks over becoming david moyes' replacement at west ham, before later apologising for the timing and publicity of the talks in london.
at the age of 36, amorim led sporting to a first league title in 19 years in 2021 and then won his second with the club last season.
he has also won the taca da liga - the portuguese league cup - on three occasions, twice with sporting and once with braga.
a former benfica and portugal midfielder, amorim retired as a player in 2017 and just two years later he took up his first managerial job at braga.
he then joined sporting in march 2020 where he has established himself as one of europe's most sought-after young coaches.
amorim has emerged as the leading candidate to replace ten hag at man utd, although sources insist an announcement on the new permanent manager is not imminent.
a deal has not been done yet, but advanced discussions have not been denied by any of the parties involved.
having been pipped to the liverpool job by arne slot and showing regret over a very public flirtation with west ham in april, the 39-year-old's next step was destined to be in the premier league.
amorim was linked with the west ham job, the liverpool job and there is even talk of him being a manchester city manager one day.
he is one of the most coveted young coaches in europe at the moment.
it is not just united who are interested.
sporting had to pay a big release clause to get him in the first place and united will have to pay €10m (£8.3m) to get him.
winning the title with sporting in 2021 at the age of 36 all but guaranteed that.
sporting recognised that this was a special talent very early, famously paying a huge release clause after his spectacular start at braga.
his only aim is to maintain the standards.
i have been around too many years to know that honeymoons do not last forever, you know?
the problem is to sustain it.
it is very difficult.
he is still doing it his way, although, in terms of the game's wider trends, that has never been less fashionable.
until friday, they ranked bottom for winning the ball high up the pitch.
forest were bottom for that too, waiting longer than any team to initiate the press.
inside an office at the city ground, it is an opportunity to put some of these statistics to nuno.
he listens, engages with the detail in the data, but offers little more than a smile in response.
it's crazy, no?
he is not trying to be cute.
it is no secret to anyone, he adds.
it is not about that.
he does not point to his record either, but he could.
he came to forest having won the title in saudi arabia, his reputation in england forged by taking wolves from the championship to europe.
he competed in the champions league with valencia and porto.
he is entitled to believe his way works.
it is not luck.
they let the opponent only so far.
most attacks do not result in a shot let alone a goal.
there is an example from the win over liverpool that resulted in a chance for anthony elanga.
virgil van dijk attempts a pass between the lines but it is a trap.
nuno argues it is not the same.
it is totally different, he says.
totally different.
for starters, there is the formation.
nuno used to deploy five in defence, now he operates with four at the back.
but it is more subtle than that.
the traps forest set are different.
there is no way through.
from there, they spring morgan gibbs-white and their wingers.
it was the first time in his career that he had taken a job midway through a campaign.
the change began in earnest during pre-season training in spain.
he used that time to correct their defending of set pieces.
many, many, many sessions.
the improvement has been dramatic.
but it goes much deeper.
it is not just about the tactical, it is the bonds.
that involved testing players to their limit.
it was very hot and they played for one hour, he adds.
nuno sees that togetherness now, too.
everyone at forest is enjoying the benefit of that work now.
they are organised and resolute, comfortable out of possession and regularly thrilling in it.
just do not expect him to relish the compliments that come with it.
as former forest midfielder roy keane is fond of saying, it's his job.

thomas frank and ruben amorim have emerged as the early favourites to succeed erik ten hag as the manchester united manager after the dutchman was sacked on monday.
the football association has launched a new four-year strategy which aims to transform the landscape of the grassroots level.

graham potter would be interested in taking over the ibrox hot-seat, according to former england goalkeeper paul robinson.
ten hag leaves man utd in 14th place in the premier league and without a win in their europa league campaign so far, with his final game being the 2-1 defeat at west ham on sunday, where united missed a host of chances before falling to a controversial penalty in injury-time.
it is a real struggle watching them play and it hasn't changed in the last 18 months.
bruno fernandes was sent off with the score at 1-0 just before half-time in that game and it meant they had lost back-to-back premier league games at old trafford by a 3-0 scoreline after going down to their big rivals liverpool at the start of the month.
you look at who is available then you try to think of the timing.
they have chosen a moment that was decided a few weeks ago.
that has come yesterday (sunday).
they would have started the process of finding erik ten hag's successor.
it was a bad day for manchester united and a bad day for erik ten hag.
it's got worse from then.
i don't think anybody will be truly shocked.
ruud van nistelrooy will take temporary charge of the team until a permanent successor is found.
what is he going to be able to do?
i'd be amazed if something drastic is done in the next few days, said neville.
whether ruud does that, i'm not sure.
i would not change anything in the january transfer window.
